The restful library provides a way to specify basic restful routes (get, post, put, delete)
with minimal coding effort. The restful.js file provides the abstract Restful class, which is
derived from APIServerModule. Modules can derive from the Restful class to easily get restful
functionality associated with a collection. The derived module can then specify which
operations it wants to support, which translates into routes exposed through express.

The restful library assumes a data collection (from the dataCollection library)
made up of database-persistent documents that, when manipulated in memory, translate into models.
