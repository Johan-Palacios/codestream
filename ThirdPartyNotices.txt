# Slack Web API  <!-- TODO: per-job badge https://github.com/bjfish/travis-matrix-badges/issues/4 --> [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/slackapi/node-slack-sdk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/slackapi/node-slack-sdk) <!-- TODO: per-flag badge https://docs.codecov.io/docs/flags#section-flag-badges-and-graphs --> [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/slackapi/node-slack-sdk/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/slackapi/node-slack-sdk) <!-- TODO: npm versions with scoped packages: https://github.com/rvagg/nodei.co/issues/24 -->  The `@slack/web-api` package contains a simple, convenient, and configurable HTTP client for making requests to Slack's [Web API](https://api.slack.com/web). Use it in your app to call any of the over 130 [methods](https://api.slack.com/methods), and let it handle formatting, queuing, retrying, pagination, and more.  ## Installation  ```shell $ npm install @slack/web-api ```  <!-- START: Remove before copying into the docs directory -->  ## Usage  These examples show the most common features of the `WebClient`. You'll find even more extensive [documentation on the package's website](https://slack.dev/node-slack-sdk/web-api).  <!-- END: Remove before copying into the docs directory -->  ---  ### Initialize the client  The package exports a `WebClient` class. All you need to do is instantiate it, and you're ready to go. You'll typically initialize it with a `token`, so that you don't have to provide the token each time you call a method. A token usually begins with `xoxb` or `xoxp`. You get them from each workspace an app is installed onto. The app configuration pages help you get your first token for your development workspace.  ```javascript const { WebClient } = require('@slack/web-api');  // Read a token from the environment variables const token = process.env.SLACK_TOKEN;  // Initialize const web = new WebClient(token); ```  <details> <summary markdown="span"> <strong><i>Initializing without a token</i></strong> </summary>  Alternatively, you can create a client without a token, and use it with multiple workspaces as long as you supply a `token` when you call a method.  ```javascript const { WebClient } = require('@slack/web-api');  // Initialize a single instance for the whole app const web = new WebClient();  // Find a token in storage (database) before making an API method call (async () => {   // Some fictitious database   const token = await db.findTokenByTeam(teamId, enterpriseId)    // Call the method   const result = web.auth.test({ token }); })(); ``` </details>  ---  ### Call a method  The client instance has a named method for each of the public methods in the Web API. The most popular one is called `chat.postMessage`, and it's used to send a message to a conversation. For every method, you pass arguments as properties of an options object. This helps with the readability of your code since every argument has a name. All named methods return a `Promise` which resolves with the response data or rejects with an error.  ```javascript // Given some known conversation ID (representing a public channel, private channel, DM or group DM) const conversationId = '...';  (async () => {    // Post a message to the channel, and await the result.   // Find more arguments and details of the response: https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage   const result = await web.chat.postMessage({     text: 'Hello world!',     channel: conversationId,   });    // The result contains an identifier for the message, `ts`.   console.log(`Successfully send message ${result.ts} in conversation ${conversationId}`); })(); ```  **Tip**: If you're using an editor that supports TypeScript, even if you're not using TypeScript to write your code, you'll get hints for all the arguments each method supports. This helps you save time by reducing the number of times you need to pop out to a webpage to check the reference. There's more information about [using TypeScript](https://slack.dev/node-slack-sdk/typescript) with this package in the documentation website.  **Tip**: Use the [Block Kit Builder](https://api.slack.com/tools/block-kit-builder) for a playground where you can prototype your message's look and feel.  <details> <summary markdown="span"> <strong><i>Using a dynamic method name</i></strong> </summary>  If you want to provide the method name as a string so that you can decide which method to call dynamically or to call a method that might not be available in your version of the client, use the `WebClient.apiCall(methodName, [options])` method. The API method call above can also be written as follows:  ```javascript const conversationId = '...'; (async () => {    // Using apiCall() allows the app to call any method and to do it programmatically   const response = await web.apiCall('chat.postMessage', {     text: 'Hello world!',     channel: conversationId,   }); })(); ``` </details>  ---  ### Handle errors  Errors can happen for many reasons: maybe the token doesn't have the proper [scopes](https://api.slack.com/scopes) to call a method, maybe its been revoked by a user, or maybe you just used a bad argument. In these cases, the returned `Promise` will reject with an `Error`. You should catch the error and use the information it contains to decide how your app can proceed.  Each error contains a `code` property, which you can check against the `ErrorCode` export to understand the kind of error you're dealing with. For example, when Slack responds to your app with an error, that is an `ErrorCode.PlatformError`. These types of errors provide Slack's response body as the `data` property.  ```javascript // Import ErrorCode from the package const { WebClient, ErrorCode } = require('@slack/web-api');  (async () => {    try {     // This method call should fail because we're giving it a bogus user ID to lookup.     const response = await web.users.info({ user: '...' });   } catch (error) {     // Check the code property, and when its a PlatformError, log the whole response.     if (error.code === ErrorCode.PlatformError) {       console.log(error.data);     } else {       // Some other error, oh no!       console.log('Well, that was unexpected.');     }   } })(); ```  <details> <summary markdown="span"> <strong><i>More error types</i></strong> </summary>  There are a few more types of errors that you might encounter, each with one of these `code`s:  * `ErrorCode.RequestError`: A request could not be sent. A common reason for this is that your network connection is   not available, or `api.slack.com` could not be reached. This error has an `original` property with more details.  * `ErrorCode.RateLimitedError`: The Web API cannot fulfill the API method call because your app has made too many   requests too quickly. This error has a `retryAfter` property with the number of seconds you should wait before trying   again. See [the documentation on rate limit handling](https://slack.dev/node-slack-sdk/web-api/#rate-limits) to   understand how the client will automatically deal with these problems for you.  * `ErrorCode.HTTPError`: The HTTP response contained an unfamiliar status code. The Web API only responds with `200`   (yes, even for errors) or `429` (rate limiting). If you receive this error, it's likely due to a problem with a proxy,   a custom TLS configuration, or a custom API URL. This error has the `statusCode`, `statusMessage`, `headers`, and   `body` properties containing more details. </details>  ---  ### Pagination  [Many of the Web API's methods](https://api.slack.com/docs/pagination#methods_supporting_cursor-based_pagination) return lists of objects, and are known to be **cursor-paginated**. The result of calling these methods will contain a part of the list, or a page, and also provide you with information on how to continue to the next page on a subsequent API call. Instead of calling many times manually, the `WebClient` can manage to get each page, allowing you to determine when to stop, and help you process the results.  The process of retrieving multiple pages from Slack's API can be described as **asynchronous iteration**, which means you're processing items in a collection, but getting each item is an asynchronous operation. Fortunately, JavaScript has this concept built-in, and in newer versions of the language there's a syntax to make it even simpler: [`for await...of`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of).  ```javascript (async () => {   let result;    // Async iteration is similar to a simple for loop.   // Use only the first two parameters to get an async iterator.   for await (const page of web.paginate('something.list', { name: 'value' })) {     // You can inspect each page, find your result, and stop the loop with a `break` statement     if (containsTheThing(page.something)) {       result = page.something.thing;       break;     }   } }); ```  The `for await...of` syntax is available in Node v10.0.0 and above. If you're using an older version of Node, see functional iteration below.  <details> <summary markdown="span"> <strong><i>Using functional iteration</i></strong> </summary>  The `.paginate()` method can accept up to two additional parameters. The third parameter, `stopFn`, is a function that is called once for each page of the result, and should return `true` when the app no longer needs to get another page. The fourth parameter is `reducerFn`, which is a function that gets called once for each page of the result, but can be used to aggregate a result. The value it returns is used to call it the next time as the `accumulator`. The first time it gets called, the `accumulator` is undefined.  ```javascript (async () => {    // The first two parameters are the method name and the options object.   const done = await web.paginate('something.list', { name: 'value' },     // The third is a function that receives each page and should return true when the next page isn't needed.     (page) => { /* ... */ },     // The fourth is a reducer function, similar to the callback parameter of Array.prototype.reduce().     // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce     // The accumulator is initialized to undefined.     (accumulator, page, index) => { /* ... */ },   ); }); ```  The returned value is a `Promise`, but what it resolves to depends on whether or not you include the fourth (optional) parameter. If you don't include it, the resolved value is always `undefined`. In this case, its used for control flow purposes (resuming the rest of your program), and the function in the third parameter is used to capture a result. If you do include the fourth parameter, then the resolved value is the value of the `accumulator`. This is a familiar pattern for people that use _functional programming_.  </details>  ---  ### Logging  The `WebClient` will log interesting information to the console by default. You can use the `logLevel` to decide how much information, or how interesting the information needs to be, in order for it to be output. There are a few possible log levels, which you can find in the `LogLevel` export. By default, the value is set to `LogLevel.INFO`. While you're in development, its sometimes helpful to set this to the most verbose: `LogLevel.DEBUG`.  ```javascript // Import LogLevel from the package const { WebClient, LogLevel } = require('@slack/web-api');  // Log level is one of the options you can set in the constructor const web = new WebClient(token, {   logLevel: LogLevel.DEBUG, }); ```  All the log levels, in order of most to least information, are: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, and `ERROR`.  <details> <summary markdown="span"> <strong><i>Sending log output somewhere besides the console</i></strong> </summary>  You can also choose to have logs sent to a custom logger using the `logger` option. A custom logger needs to implement specific methods (known as the `Logger` interface):  | Method       | Parameters        | Return type | |--------------|-------------------|-------------| | `setLevel()` | `level: LogLevel` | `void`      | | `setName()`  | `name: string`    | `void`      | | `debug()`    | `...msgs: any[]`  | `void`      | | `info()`     | `...msgs: any[]`  | `void`      | | `warn()`     | `...msgs: any[]`  | `void`      | | `error()`    | `...msgs: any[]`  | `void`      |  A very simple custom logger might ignore the name and level, and write all messages to a file.  ```javascript const { createWriteStream } = require('fs'); const logWritable = createWriteStream('/var/my_log_file'); // Not shown: close this stream  const web = new WebClient(token, {   // Creating a logger as a literal object. It's more likely that you'd create a class.   logger: {     debug(...msgs): { logWritable.write('debug: ' + JSON.stringify(msgs)); },     info(...msgs): { logWritable.write('info: ' + JSON.stringify(msgs)); },     warn(...msgs): { logWritable.write('warn: ' + JSON.stringify(msgs)); },     error(...msgs): { logWritable.write('error: ' + JSON.stringify(msgs)); },     setLevel(): { },     setName(): { },   }, }); ``` </details>  ---  ### Automatic retries  In production systems, you want your app to be resilient to short hiccups and temporary outages. Solving for this problem usually involves building a queuing system that handles retrying failed tasks. The `WebClient` comes with this queuing system out of the box, and it's on by default! The client will retry a failed API method call up to 10 times, spaced out over about 30 minutes. If the request doesn't succeed within that time, then the returned `Promise` will reject. You can observe each of the retries in your logs by [setting the log level to DEBUG](#logging). Try running the following code with your network disconnected, and then re-connect after you see a couple of log messages:  ```javascript const { WebClient, LogLevel } = require('@slack/web-api');  const web = new WebClient('bogus token');  (async () => {   await web.auth.test();    console.log('Done!'); })(); ```  Shortly after re-connecting your network, you should see the `Done!` message. Did you notice the program doesn't use a valid token? The client is doing something clever and helpful here. It knows the difference between an error such as not being able to reach `api.slack.com` and an error in the response from Slack about an invalid token. The former is something that can be resolved with a retry, so it was retried. The invalid token error means that the call isn't going to succeed until your app does something differently, so it stops attempting retries.  You might not think 10 reties in 30 minutes is a good policy for your app. No problem, you can set the `retryConfig` to one that works better for you. The `retryPolicies` export contains a few well known options, and you can always write your own.  ```javascript const { WebClient, retryPolicies } = require('@slack/web-api');  const web = new WebClient(token, {   retryConfig: retryPolicies.fiveRetriesInFiveMinutes, }); ```  Here are some other values that you might want to use for `retryConfig`:  | `retryConfig`                                  | Description                     | |------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------| | `retryPolicies.tenRetriesInAboutThirtyMinutes` | (default)                       | | `retryPolicies.fiveRetriesInFiveMinutes`       | Five attempts in five minutes   | | `retryPolicies.rapidRetryPolicy`               | Used to keep tests running fast | | `{ retries: 0 }`                               | No retries ([other options](https://github.com/tim-kos/node-retry#retryoperationoptions)) |  **Note**: If an API call results in a rate limit being exceeded, you might still notice the client automatically retrying the API call. If you'd like to opt out of that behavior, set the `rejectRateLimitedCalls` option to `true`.  ---  ### More  The [documentation website](https://slack.dev/node-slack-sdk/web-api) has information about these additional features of the `WebClient`:  *  Upload a file with a `Buffer` or a `ReadableStream`. *  Using a custom agent for proxying *  Rate limit handling *  Request concurrency *  Custom TLS configuration *  Custom API URL *  Exchange an OAuth grant for a token  ---  ## Requirements  This package supports Node v8 LTS and higher. It's highly recommended to use [the latest LTS version of node](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule), and the documentation is written using syntax and features from that version.  ## Getting Help  If you get stuck, we're here to help.

agent-base ========== ### Turn a function into an [`http.Agent`][http.Agent] instance [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-agent-base.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-agent-base)  This module provides an `http.Agent` generator. That is, you pass it an async callback function, and it returns a new `http.Agent` instance that will invoke the given callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.  #### Some subclasses:  Here's some more interesting uses of `agent-base`. Send a pull request to list yours!   * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints  * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints  * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS  * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS (v4a) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS   Installation ------------  Install with `npm`:  ``` bash $ npm install agent-base ```   Example -------  Here's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` connection to the server for every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of `agent: false` option):  ```js var net = require('net'); var tls = require('tls'); var url = require('url'); var http = require('http'); var agent = require('agent-base');  var endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/'; var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);  // This is the important part! parsed.agent = agent(function (req, opts) {   var socket;   // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the https module   if (opts.secureEndpoint) {     socket = tls.connect(opts);   } else {     socket = net.connect(opts);   }   return socket; });  // Everything else works just like normal... http.get(parsed, function (res) {   console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);   res.pipe(process.stdout); }); ```  Returning a Promise or using an `async` function is also supported:  ```js agent(async function (req, opts) {   await sleep(1000);   // etc… }); ```  Return another `http.Agent` instance to "pass through" the responsibility for that HTTP request to that agent:  ```js agent(function (req, opts) {   return opts.secureEndpoint ? https.globalAgent : http.globalAgent; }); ```   API ---  ## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) → [http.Agent][]  Creates a base `http.Agent` that will execute the callback function `callback` for every HTTP request that it is used as the `agent` for. The callback function is responsible for creating a `stream.Duplex` instance of some kind that will be used as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.  The `options` object accepts the following properties:    * `timeout` - Number - Timeout for the `callback()` function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).  The callback function should have the following signature:  ### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) → undefined  The ClientRequest `req` can be accessed to read request headers and and the path, etc. The `options` object contains the options passed to the `http.request()`/`https.request()` function call, and is formatted to be directly passed to `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()`, or however else you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to the callback function `cb` once created, and the HTTP request will continue to proceed.  If the `https` module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the `secureEndpoint` property on `options` _will be set to `true`_.

Support `http` and `https`.  ## What's different from original `http.Agent`?  - `keepAlive=true` by default - Disable Nagle's algorithm: `socket.setNoDelay(true)` - Add free socket timeout: avoid long time inactivity socket leak in the free-sockets queue. - Add active socket timeout: avoid long time inactivity socket leak in the active-sockets queue.  ## Install  ```bash $ npm install agentkeepalive --save ```  ## new Agent([options])  * `options` {Object} Set of configurable options to set on the agent.   Can have the following fields:   * `keepAlive` {Boolean} Keep sockets around in a pool to be used by     other requests in the future. Default = `true`.   * `keepAliveMsecs` {Number} When using the keepAlive option, specifies the initial delay     for TCP Keep-Alive packets. Ignored when the keepAlive option is false or undefined. Defaults to 1000.     Default = `1000`.  Only relevant if `keepAlive` is set to `true`.   * `freeSocketKeepAliveTimeout`: {Number} Sets the free socket to timeout     after `freeSocketKeepAliveTimeout` milliseconds of inactivity on the free socket.     Default is `15000`.     Only relevant if `keepAlive` is set to `true`.   * `timeout`: {Number} Sets the working socket to timeout     after `timeout` milliseconds of inactivity on the working socket.     Default is `freeSocketKeepAliveTimeout * 2`.   * `maxSockets` {Number} Maximum number of sockets to allow per     host. Default = `Infinity`.   * `maxFreeSockets` {Number} Maximum number of sockets (per host) to leave open     in a free state. Only relevant if `keepAlive` is set to `true`.     Default = `256`.   * `socketActiveTTL` {Number} Sets the socket active time to live, even if it's in use.     If not setted the behaviour continues the same (the socket will be released only when free)     Default = `null`.  ## Usage  ```js const http = require('http'); const Agent = require('agentkeepalive');  const keepaliveAgent = new Agent({   maxSockets: 100,   maxFreeSockets: 10,   timeout: 60000,   freeSocketKeepAliveTimeout: 30000, // free socket keepalive for 30 seconds });  const options = {   host: 'cnodejs.org',   port: 80,   path: '/',   method: 'GET',   agent: keepaliveAgent, };  const req = http.request(options, res => {   console.log('STATUS: ' + res.statusCode);   console.log('HEADERS: ' + JSON.stringify(res.headers));   res.setEncoding('utf8');   res.on('data', function (chunk) {     console.log('BODY: ' + chunk);   }); }); req.on('error', e => {   console.log('problem with request: ' + e.message); }); req.end();  setTimeout(() => {   if (keepaliveAgent.statusChanged) {     console.log('[%s] agent status changed: %j', Date(), keepaliveAgent.getCurrentStatus());   } }, 2000);  ```  ### `getter agent.statusChanged`  counters have change or not after last checkpoint.  ### `agent.getCurrentStatus()`  `agent.getCurrentStatus()` will return a object to show the status of this agent:  ```js {   createSocketCount: 10,   closeSocketCount: 5,   timeoutSocketCount: 0,   requestCount: 5,   freeSockets: { 'localhost:57479:': 3 },   sockets: { 'localhost:57479:': 5 },   requests: {} } ```  ### Support `https`  ```js const https = require('https'); const HttpsAgent = require('agentkeepalive').HttpsAgent;  const keepaliveAgent = new HttpsAgent(); // https://www.google.com/search?q=nodejs&sugexp=chrome,mod=12&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8 const options = {   host: 'www.google.com',   port: 443,   path: '/search?q=nodejs&sugexp=chrome,mod=12&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8',   method: 'GET',   agent: keepaliveAgent, };  const req = https.request(options, res => {   console.log('STATUS: ' + res.statusCode);   console.log('HEADERS: ' + JSON.stringify(res.headers));   res.setEncoding('utf8');   res.on('data', chunk => {     console.log('BODY: ' + chunk);   }); });  req.on('error', e => {   console.log('problem with request: ' + e.message); }); req.end();  setTimeout(() => {   console.log('agent status: %j', keepaliveAgent.getCurrentStatus()); }, 2000); ```  ## [Benchmark](https://github.com/node-modules/agentkeepalive/tree/master/benchmark)  run the benchmark:  ```bash cd benchmark sh start.sh ```  Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU     P8600  @ 2.40GHz  node@v0.8.9  50 maxSockets, 60 concurrent, 1000 requests per concurrent, 5ms delay  Keep alive agent (30 seconds):  ```js Transactions:          60000 hits Availability:         100.00 % Elapsed time:          29.70 secs Data transferred:        14.88 MB Response time:            0.03 secs Transaction rate:      2020.20 trans/sec Throughput:           0.50 MB/sec Concurrency:           59.84 Successful transactions:       60000 Failed transactions:             0 Longest transaction:          0.15 Shortest transaction:         0.01 ```  Normal agent:  ```js Transactions:          60000 hits Availability:         100.00 % Elapsed time:          46.53 secs Data transferred:        14.88 MB Response time:            0.05 secs Transaction rate:      1289.49 trans/sec Throughput:           0.32 MB/sec Concurrency:           59.81 Successful transactions:       60000 Failed transactions:             0 Longest transaction:          0.45 Shortest transaction:         0.00 ```  Socket created:  ``` [proxy.js:120000] keepalive, 50 created, 60000 requestFinished, 1200 req/socket, 0 requests, 0 sockets, 0 unusedSockets, 50 timeout {" <10ms":662," <15ms":17825," <20ms":20552," <30ms":17646," <40ms":2315," <50ms":567," <100ms":377," <150ms":56," <200ms":0," >=200ms+":0} ---------------------------------------------------------------- [proxy.js:120000] normal   , 53866 created, 84260 requestFinished, 1.56 req/socket, 0 requests, 0 sockets {" <10ms":75," <15ms":1112," <20ms":10947," <30ms":32130," <40ms":8228," <50ms":3002," <100ms":4274," <150ms":181," <200ms":18," >=200ms+":33} ```  ## License  ``` (The MIT License)  Copyright(c) node-modules and other contributors.

%% assert-plus@1.0.0 NOTICES AND INFORMATION BEGIN HERE:
=========================================

# assert-plus  This library is a super small wrapper over node's assert module that has two things: (1) the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable NODE\_NDEBUG, and (2) some API wrappers for argument testing.  Like `assert.string(myArg, 'myArg')`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks like this:  ```javascript     var assert = require('assert-plus');      function fooAccount(options, callback) {         assert.object(options, 'options');         assert.number(options.id, 'options.id');         assert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');         assert.string(options.name, 'options.name');         assert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');         assert.func(callback, 'callback');          // Do stuff         callback(null, {});     } ```  # API  All methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to take an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError` will be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:      AssertionError: foo (string) is required     at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)     at Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)     at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)     at Object..js (module.js:464:10)     at Module.load (module.js:353:31)     at Function._load (module.js:311:12)     at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)     at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)  from:  ```javascript     function test(foo) {         assert.string(foo, 'foo');     } ```  There you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogeneous type with `Arrayof$Type`:  ```javascript     function test(foo) {         assert.arrayOfString(foo, 'foo');     } ```  You can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):  ```javascript     assert.optionalString(foo, 'foo'); ```  Lastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the environment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have lots of assertions, and don't want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in production.  Be advised:  The standard functions re-exported from `assert` are also disabled in assert-plus if NDEBUG is specified.  Using them directly from the `assert` module avoids this behavior.  The complete list of APIs is:  * assert.array * assert.bool * assert.buffer * assert.func * assert.number * assert.finite * assert.object * assert.string * assert.stream * assert.date * assert.regexp * assert.uuid * assert.arrayOfArray * assert.arrayOfBool * assert.arrayOfBuffer * assert.arrayOfFunc * assert.arrayOfNumber * assert.arrayOfFinite * assert.arrayOfObject * assert.arrayOfString * assert.arrayOfStream * assert.arrayOfDate * assert.arrayOfRegexp * assert.arrayOfUuid * assert.optionalArray * assert.optionalBool * assert.optionalBuffer * assert.optionalFunc * assert.optionalNumber * assert.optionalFinite * assert.optionalObject * assert.optionalString * assert.optionalStream * assert.optionalDate * assert.optionalRegexp * assert.optionalUuid * assert.optionalArrayOfArray * assert.optionalArrayOfBool * assert.optionalArrayOfBuffer * assert.optionalArrayOfFunc * assert.optionalArrayOfNumber * assert.optionalArrayOfFinite * assert.optionalArrayOfObject * assert.optionalArrayOfString * assert.optionalArrayOfStream * assert.optionalArrayOfDate * assert.optionalArrayOfRegexp * assert.optionalArrayOfUuid * assert.AssertionError * assert.fail * assert.ok * assert.equal * assert.notEqual * assert.deepEqual * assert.notDeepEqual * assert.strictEqual * assert.notStrictEqual * assert.throws * assert.doesNotThrow * assert.ifError  # Installation      npm install assert-plus  ## License  The MIT License (MIT) Copyright (c) 2012 Mark Cavage  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

If You       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.     4.

The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

%% boolbase@1.0.0 NOTICES AND INFORMATION BEGIN HERE:
=========================================

#boolbase This very simple module provides two basic functions, one that always returns true (`trueFunc`) and one that always returns false (`falseFunc`).  ###WTF?  By having only a single instance of these functions around, it's possible to do some nice optimizations. Eg. [`CSSselect`](https://github.com/fb55/CSSselect) uses these functions to determine whether a selector won't match any elements. If that's the case, the DOM doesn't even have to be touched.  ###And why is this a separate module?  I'm trying to modularize `CSSselect` and most modules depend on these functions. IMHO, having a separate module is the easiest solution to this problem.

This library contains most of the core functionality for [Bot Builder](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js/tree/master/libraries/botbuilder), but without any dependency on Node. As a result, this version can be used to build bots that run complete in a browser.  Unless you are building a bot or component _without Node_, we recommend that you `botbuilder` your app instead of `botbuilder-core`. [Learn more here.](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js/tree/master/libraries/botbuilder/README.md)  - [Installing](#installing) - [Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-overview-introduction?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) - [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js) - [Report Issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js/issues)  ## Installing To add the latset published version of this package to your bot:  ```bash npm install --save botbuilder-core ```  #### Use the Daily Build  To get access to the daily builds of this library, configure npm to use the MyGet feed before installing.  ```bash npm config set registry https://botbuilder.myget.org/F/botbuilder-v4-js-daily/npm/ ```  To reset the registry in order to get the latest published version, run: ```bash npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/ ```

# Bot Builder for Node.js [Bot Builder for Node.js](http://docs.botframework.com/builder/node/overview/) is a powerful framework for constructing bots that can handle both freeform interactions and more guided ones where the possibilities are explicitly shown to the user. It is easy to use and models frameworks like Express & Restify to provide developers with a familiar way to write Bots.  - [Installing](#installing) - [Basic Use](#build-a-bot) - [Learn More](#learn-more) - [Sample Apps](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples) - [Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-overview-introduction?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) - [Class Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/botbuilder/) - [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js) - [Report Issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js/issues)  ## Installing To add the latest version of this package to your bot:  ```bash npm install --save botbuilder ```  #### Use the Daily Build  To get access to the daily builds of this library, configure npm to use the MyGet feed before installing.  ```bash npm config set registry https://botbuilder.myget.org/F/botbuilder-v4-js-daily/npm/ ```  To reset the registry in order to get the latest published version, run: ```bash npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/ ```  ## What's included?  Bot Builder has everything you need to run a bot on almost any bot platform like the [Microsoft Bot Framework](http://botframework.com), [Skype](http://skype.com), and [Slack](http://slack.com). The core library will get your bot online and chatting. Then, extend and connect your Bot Builder app with these plugins:  | Plugin | Description |--- |--- | [botbuilder-dialogs](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-js/tree/master/libraries/botbuilder-dialogs/README.md) | Powerful dialog system with dialogs that are isolated and composable, and built-in prompts for simple things like Yes/No, strings, numbers, enumerations. | [botbuilder-ai](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-js/tree/master/libraries/botbuilder-dialogs/README.md) | Utilize powerful AI frameworks like [LUIS](https://www.luis.ai) and [QnA Maker](https://www.qnamaker.ai). | [botbuilder-azure](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-js/tree/master/libraries/botbuilder-azure/README.md) | Incorporate Azure services like Cosmos DB and Blob Storage into your bot.  ## Build a bot [Read the quickstart guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/javascript/bot-builder-javascript-quickstart?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)  that will walk you through setting up your Bot Builder app so that you've got a well structured project and all of the tools necessary to develop and extend your bot.   ### Start from scratch Create a folder for your bot, cd into it, and run npm init.  ``` npm init ```      Get the BotBuilder and Restify modules using npm.  ``` npm install --save botbuilder npm install --save restify ```      Create a file named bot.js and get your bot online with a few lines of code.   ```javascript const restify = require('restify'); const botbuilder = require('botbuilder');  // Create bot adapter, which defines how the bot sends and receives messages. var adapter = new botbuilder.BotFrameworkAdapter({     appId: process.env.MicrosoftAppId,     appPassword: process.env.MicrosoftAppPassword });  // Create HTTP server. let server = restify.createServer(); server.listen(process.env.port || process.env.PORT || 3978, function () {     console.log(`\n${server.name} listening to ${server.url}`);     console.log(`\nGet Bot Framework Emulator: https://aka.ms/botframework-emulator`); });  // Listen for incoming requests at /api/messages. server.post('/api/messages', (req, res) => {     // Use the adapter to process the incoming web request into a TurnContext object.     adapter.processActivity(req, res, async (turnContext) => {         // Do something with this incoming activity!         if (turnContext.activity.type === 'message') {                         // Get the user's text             const utterance = turnContext.activity.text;              // send a reply             await turnContext.sendActivity(`I heard you say ${ utterance }`);         }     }); }); ```  ## Test your bot Use the [Bot Framework Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-debug-emulator?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) to test your bot on localhost.   Install the emulator from [here](https://aka.ms/botframework-emulator) and then start your bot in a console window.      Start the emulator and say "hello" to your bot.  ## Publish your bot Deploy your bot to the cloud and then [register it](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) with the Azure Bot Service.  ## Learn More Learn how to build great bots.  * [Core Concepts Guide](http://docs.botframework.com/builder/node/guides/core-concepts/) * [Bot Builder for Node.js Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/botbuilder/)

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Cheerio removes all the DOM inconsistencies and browser cruft from the jQuery library, revealing its truly gorgeous API.  __&#991; Blazingly fast:__ Cheerio works with a very simple, consistent DOM model. As a result parsing, manipulating, and rendering are incredibly efficient. Preliminary end-to-end benchmarks suggest that cheerio is about __8x__ faster than JSDOM.  __&#10049; Incredibly flexible:__ Cheerio wraps around @FB55's forgiving [htmlparser2](https://github.com/fb55/htmlparser2/). Cheerio can parse nearly any HTML or XML document.  ## Sponsors  Does your company use Cheerio in production? Please consider [sponsoring this project](https://opencollective.com/cheerio#sponsor).

API  ### Markup example we'll be using:  ```html <ul id="fruits">   <li class="apple">Apple</li>   <li class="orange">Orange</li>   <li class="pear">Pear</li> </ul> ```  This is the HTML markup we will be using in all of the API examples.  ### Loading First you need to load in the HTML. This step in jQuery is implicit, since jQuery operates on the one, baked-in DOM. With Cheerio, we need to pass in the HTML document.  This is the _preferred_ method:  ```js var cheerio = require('cheerio'),     $ = cheerio.load('<ul id="fruits">...</ul>'); ```  Optionally, you can also load in the HTML by passing the string as the context:  ```js $ = require('cheerio'); $('ul', '<ul id="fruits">...</ul>'); ```  Or as the root:  ```js $ = require('cheerio'); $('li', 'ul', '<ul id="fruits">...</ul>'); ```  You can also pass an extra object to `.load()` if you need to modify any of the default parsing options:  ```js $ = cheerio.load('<ul id="fruits">...</ul>', {     normalizeWhitespace: true,     xmlMode: true }); ```  These parsing options are taken directly from [htmlparser2](https://github.com/fb55/htmlparser2/wiki/Parser-options), therefore any options that can be used in `htmlparser2` are valid in cheerio as well. The default options are:  ```js {     withDomLvl1: true,     normalizeWhitespace: false,     xmlMode: false,     decodeEntities: true }  ```  For a full list of options and their effects, see [this](https://github.com/fb55/DomHandler) and [htmlparser2's options](https://github.com/fb55/htmlparser2/wiki/Parser-options).  ### Selectors  Cheerio's selector implementation is nearly identical to jQuery's, so the API is very similar.  #### $( selector, [context], [root] ) `selector` searches within the `context` scope which searches within the `root` scope. `selector` and `context` can be a string expression, DOM Element, array of DOM elements, or cheerio object. `root` is typically the HTML document string.  This selector method is the starting point for traversing and manipulating the document. Like jQuery, it's the primary method for selecting elements in the document, but unlike jQuery it's built on top of the CSSSelect library, which implements most of the Sizzle selectors.  ```js $('.apple', '#fruits').text() //=> Apple  $('ul .pear').attr('class') //=> pear  $('li[class=orange]').html() //=> Orange ```  ### Attributes Methods for getting and modifying attributes.  #### .attr( name, value ) Method for getting and setting attributes. Gets the attribute value for only the first element in the matched set. If you set an attribute's value to `null`, you remove that attribute. You may also pass a `map` and `function` like jQuery.  ```js $('ul').attr('id') //=> fruits  $('.apple').attr('id', 'favorite').html() //=> <li class="apple" id="favorite">Apple</li> ```  > See http://api.jquery.com/attr/ for more information  #### .prop( name, value ) Method for getting and setting properties. Gets the property value for only the first element in the matched set.  ```js $('input[type="checkbox"]').prop('checked') //=> false  $('input[type="checkbox"]').prop('checked', true).val() //=> ok ```  > See http://api.jquery.com/prop/ for more information  #### .data( name, value ) Method for getting and setting data attributes. Gets or sets the data attribute value for only the first element in the matched set.  ```js $('<div data-apple-color="red"></div>').data() //=> { appleColor: 'red' }  $('<div data-apple-color="red"></div>').data('apple-color') //=> 'red'  var apple = $('.apple').data('kind', 'mac') apple.data('kind') //=> 'mac' ```  > See http://api.jquery.com/data/ for more information  #### .val( [value] ) Method for getting and setting the value of input, select, and textarea. Note: Support for `map`, and `function` has not been added yet.  ```js $('input[type="text"]').val() //=> input_text  $('input[type="text"]').val('test').html() //=> <input type="text" value="test"/> ```  #### .removeAttr( name ) Method for removing attributes by `name`.  ```js $('.pear').removeAttr('class').html() //=> <li>Pear</li> ```  #### .hasClass( className ) Check to see if *any* of the matched elements have the given `className`.  ```js $('.pear').hasClass('pear') //=> true  $('apple').hasClass('fruit') //=> false  $('li').hasClass('pear') //=> true ```  #### .addClass( className ) Adds class(es) to all of the matched elements. Also accepts a `function` like jQuery.  ```js $('.pear').addClass('fruit').html() //=> <li class="pear fruit">Pear</li>  $('.apple').addClass('fruit red').html() //=> <li class="apple fruit red">Apple</li> ```  > See http://api.jquery.com/addClass/ for more information.  #### .removeClass( [className] ) Removes one or more space-separated classes from the selected elements. If no `className` is defined, all classes will be removed. Also accepts a `function` like jQuery.  ```js $('.pear').removeClass('pear').html() //=> <li class="">Pear</li>  $('.apple').addClass('red').removeClass().html() //=> <li class="">Apple</li> ```  > See http://api.jquery.com/removeClass/ for more information.  #### .toggleClass( className, [switch] ) Add or remove class(es) from the matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. Also accepts a `function` like jQuery.  ```js $('.apple.green').toggleClass('fruit green red').html() //=> <li class="apple fruit red">Apple</li>  $('.apple.green').toggleClass('fruit green red', true).html() //=> <li class="apple green fruit red">Apple</li> ```  > See http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/ for more information.  #### .is( selector ) #### .is( element ) #### .is( selection ) #### .is( function(index) ) Checks the current list of elements and returns `true` if _any_ of the elements match the selector. If using an element or Cheerio selection, returns `true` if _any_ of the elements match. If using a predicate function, the function is executed in the context of the selected element, so `this` refers to the current element.  ### Forms  #### .serializeArray()  Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values.  ```js $('<form><input name="foo" value="bar" /></form>').serializeArray() //=> [ { name: 'foo', value: 'bar' } ] ```  ### Traversing  #### .find(selector) #### .find(selection) #### .find(node) Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element.  ```js $('#fruits').find('li').length //=> 3 $('#fruits').find($('.apple')).length //=> 1 ```  #### .parent([selector]) Get the parent of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector.  ```js $('.pear').parent().attr('id') //=> fruits ```  #### .parents([selector]) Get a set of parents filtered by `selector` of each element in the current set of match elements. ```js $('.orange').parents().length // => 2 $('.orange').parents('#fruits').length // => 1 ```  #### .parentsUntil([selector][,filter]) Get the ancestors of each element in the current set of matched elements, up to but not including the element matched by the selector, DOM node, or cheerio object. ```js $('.orange').parentsUntil('#food').length // => 1 ```  #### .closest(selector) For each element in the set, get the first element that matches the selector by testing the element itself and traversing up through its ancestors in the DOM tree.  ```js $('.orange').closest() // => [] $('.orange').closest('.apple') // => [] $('.orange').closest('li') // => [<li class="orange">Orange</li>] $('.orange').closest('#fruits') // => [<ul id="fruits"> ... </ul>] ```  #### .next([selector]) Gets the next sibling of the first selected element, optionally filtered by a selector.  ```js $('.apple').next().hasClass('orange') //=> true ```  #### .nextAll([selector]) Gets all the following siblings of the first selected element, optionally filtered by a selector.  ```js $('.apple').nextAll() //=> [<li class="orange">Orange</li>, <li class="pear">Pear</li>] $('.apple').nextAll('.orange') //=> [<li class="orange">Orange</li>] ```  #### .nextUntil([selector], [filter]) Gets all the following siblings up to but not including the element matched by the selector, optionally filtered by another selector.  ```js $('.apple').nextUntil('.pear') //=> [<li class="orange">Orange</li>] ```  #### .prev([selector]) Gets the previous sibling of the first selected element optionally filtered by a selector.  ```js $('.orange').prev().hasClass('apple') //=> true ```  #### .prevAll([selector]) Gets all the preceding siblings of the first selected element, optionally filtered by a selector.  ```js $('.pear').prevAll() //=> [<li class="orange">Orange</li>, <li class="apple">Apple</li>] $('.pear').prevAll('.orange') //=> [<li class="orange">Orange</li>] ```  #### .prevUntil([selector], [filter]) Gets all the preceding siblings up to but not including the element matched by the selector, optionally filtered by another selector.  ```js $('.pear').prevUntil('.apple') //=> [<li class="orange">Orange</li>] ```  #### .slice( start, [end] ) Gets the elements matching the specified range  ```js $('li').slice(1).eq(0).text() //=> 'Orange'  $('li').slice(1, 2).length //=> 1 ```  #### .siblings([selector]) Gets the first selected element's siblings, excluding itself.  ```js $('.pear').siblings().length //=> 2  $('.pear').siblings('.orange').length //=> 1  ```  #### .children([selector]) Gets the children of the first selected element.  ```js $('#fruits').children().length //=> 3  $('#fruits').children('.pear').text() //=> Pear ```  #### .contents() Gets the children of each element in the set of matched elements, including text and comment nodes.  ```js $('#fruits').contents().length //=> 3 ```  #### .each( function(index, element) ) Iterates over a cheerio object, executing a function for each matched element. When the callback is fired, the function is fired in the context of the DOM element, so `this` refers to the current element, which is equivalent to the function parameter `element`. To break out of the `each` loop early, return with `false`.  ```js var fruits = [];  $('li').each(function(i, elem) {   fruits[i] = $(this).text(); });  fruits.join(', '); //=> Apple, Orange, Pear ```  #### .map( function(index, element) ) Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new Cheerio object containing the return values. The function can return an individual data item or an array of data items to be inserted into the resulting set. If an array is returned, the elements inside the array are inserted into the set. If the function returns null or undefined, no element will be inserted.  ```js $('li').map(function(i, el) {   // this === el   return $(this).text(); }).get().join(' '); //=> "apple orange pear" ```  #### .filter( selector ) <br /> .filter( selection ) <br /> .filter( element ) <br /> .filter( function(index) )  Iterates over a cheerio object, reducing the set of selector elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. When a Cheerio selection is specified, return only the elements contained in that selection. When an element is specified, return only that element (if it is contained in the original selection). If using the function method, the function is executed in the context of the selected element, so `this` refers to the current element.  Selector:  ```js $('li').filter('.orange').attr('class'); //=> orange ```  Function:  ```js $('li').filter(function(i, el) {   // this === el   return $(this).attr('class') === 'orange'; }).attr('class') //=> orange ```  #### .not( selector ) <br /> .not( selection ) <br /> .not( element ) <br /> .not( function(index, elem) )  Remove elements from the set of matched elements. Given a jQuery object that represents a set of DOM elements, the `.not()` method constructs a new jQuery object from a subset of the matching elements. The supplied selector is tested against each element; the elements that don't match the selector will be included in the result. The `.not()` method can take a function as its argument in the same way that `.filter()` does. Elements for which the function returns true are excluded from the filtered set; all other elements are included.  Selector:  ```js $('li').not('.apple').length; //=> 2 ```  Function:  ```js $('li').not(function(i, el) {   // this === el   return $(this).attr('class') === 'orange'; }).length; //=> 2 ```  #### .has( selector ) <br /> .has( element )  Filters the set of matched elements to only those which have the given DOM element as a descendant or which have a descendant that matches the given selector. Equivalent to `.filter(':has(selector)')`.  Selector:  ```js $('ul').has('.pear').attr('id'); //=> fruits ```  Element:  ```js $('ul').has($('.pear')[0]).attr('id'); //=> fruits ```  #### .first() Will select the first element of a cheerio object  ```js $('#fruits').children().first().text() //=> Apple ```  #### .last() Will select the last element of a cheerio object  ```js $('#fruits').children().last().text() //=> Pear ```  #### .eq( i ) Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. Use `.eq(-i)` to count backwards from the last selected element.  ```js $('li').eq(0).text() //=> Apple  $('li').eq(-1).text() //=> Pear ```  #### .get( [i] )  Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the Cheerio object. If an index is specified, retrieve one of the elements matched by the Cheerio object:  ```js $('li').get(0).tagName //=> li ```  If no index is specified, retrieve all elements matched by the Cheerio object:  ```js $('li').get().length //=> 3 ```  #### .index() #### .index( selector ) #### .index( nodeOrSelection )  Search for a given element from among the matched elements.  ```js $('.pear').index() //=> 2 $('.orange').index('li') //=> 1 $('.apple').index($('#fruit, li')) //=> 1 ```  #### .end() End the most recent filtering operation in the current chain and return the set of matched elements to its previous state.  ```js $('li').eq(0).end().length //=> 3 ```  #### .add( selector [, context] ) #### .add( element ) #### .add( elements ) #### .add( html ) #### .add( selection ) Add elements to the set of matched elements.  ```js $('.apple').add('.orange').length //=> 2 ```  #### .addBack( [filter] )  Add the previous set of elements on the stack to the current set, optionally filtered by a selector.  ```js $('li').eq(0).addBack('.orange').length //=> 2 ```  ### Manipulation Methods for modifying the DOM structure.  #### .append( content, [content, ...] ) Inserts content as the *last* child of each of the selected elements.  ```js $('ul').append('<li class="plum">Plum</li>') $.html() //=>  <ul id="fruits"> //      <li class="apple">Apple</li> //      <li class="orange">Orange</li> //      <li class="pear">Pear</li> //      <li class="plum">Plum</li> //    </ul> ```  #### .appendTo( target ) Insert every element in the set of matched elements to the end of the target.  ```js $('<li class="plum">Plum</li>').appendTo('#fruits') $.html() //=>  <ul id="fruits"> //      <li class="apple">Apple</li> //      <li class="orange">Orange</li> //      <li class="pear">Pear</li> //      <li class="plum">Plum</li> //    </ul> ```  #### .prepend( content, [content, ...] ) Inserts content as the *first* child of each of the selected elements.  ```js $('ul').prepend('<li class="plum">Plum</li>') $.html() //=>  <ul id="fruits"> //      <li class="plum">Plum</li> //      <li class="apple">Apple</li> //      <li class="orange">Orange</li> //      <li class="pear">Pear</li> //    </ul> ```  #### .prependTo( target ) Insert every element in the set of matched elements to the beginning of the target.  ```js $('<li class="plum">Plum</li>').prependTo('#fruits') $.html() //=>  <ul id="fruits"> //      <li class="plum">Plum</li> //      <li class="apple">Apple</li> //      <li class="orange">Orange</li> //      <li class="pear">Pear</li> //    </ul> ```  #### .after( content, [content, ...] ) Insert content next to each element in the set of matched elements.  ```js $('.apple').after('<li class="plum">Plum</li>') $.html() //=>  <ul id="fruits"> //      <li class="apple">Apple</li> //      <li class="plum">Plum</li> //      <li class="orange">Orange</li> //      <li class="pear">Pear</li> //    </ul> ```  #### .insertAfter( target ) Insert every element in the set of matched elements after the target.  ```js $('<li class="plum">Plum</li>').insertAfter('.apple') $.html() //=>  <ul id="fruits"> //      <li class="apple">Apple</li> //      <li class="plum">Plum</li> //      <li class="orange">Orange</li> //      <li class="pear">Pear</li> //    </ul> ```  #### .before( content, [content, ...] ) Insert content previous to each element in the set of matched elements.  ```js $('.apple').before('<li class="plum">Plum</li>') $.html() //=>  <ul id="fruits"> //      <li class="plum">Plum</li> //      <li class="apple">Apple</li> //      <li class="orange">Orange</li> //      <li class="pear">Pear</li> //    </ul> ```  #### .insertBefore( target ) Insert every element in the set of matched elements before the target.  ```js $('<li class="plum">Plum</li>').insertBefore('.apple') $.html() //=>  <ul id="fruits"> //      <li class="plum">Plum</li> //      <li class="apple">Apple</li> //      <li class="orange">Orange</li> //      <li class="pear">Pear</li> //    </ul> ```  #### .remove( [selector] ) Removes the set of matched elements from the DOM and all their children. `selector` filters the set of matched elements to be removed.  ```js $('.pear').remove() $.html() //=>  <ul id="fruits"> //      <li class="apple">Apple</li> //      <li class="orange">Orange</li> //    </ul> ```  #### .replaceWith( content ) Replaces matched elements with `content`.  ```js var plum = $('<li class="plum">Plum</li>') $('.pear').replaceWith(plum) $.html() //=> <ul id="fruits"> //     <li class="apple">Apple</li> //     <li class="orange">Orange</li> //     <li class="plum">Plum</li> //   </ul> ```  #### .empty() Empties an element, removing all its children.  ```js $('ul').empty() $.html() //=>  <ul id="fruits"></ul> ```  #### .html( [htmlString] ) Gets an html content string from the first selected element. If `htmlString` is specified, each selected element's content is replaced by the new content.  ```js $('.orange').html() //=> Orange  $('#fruits').html('<li class="mango">Mango</li>').html() //=> <li class="mango">Mango</li> ```  #### .text( [textString] ) Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants.. If `textString` is specified, each selected element's content is replaced by the new text content.  ```js $('.orange').text() //=> Orange  $('ul').text() //=>  Apple //    Orange //    Pear ```  #### .wrap( content ) The .wrap() function can take any string or object that could be passed to the $() factory function to specify a DOM structure. This structure may be nested several levels deep, but should contain only one inmost element. A copy of this structure will be wrapped around each of the elements in the set of matched elements. This method returns the original set of elements for chaining purposes.  ```js var redFruit = $('<div class="red-fruit"></div>') $('.apple').wrap(redFruit)  //=> <ul id="fruits"> //     <div class="red-fruit"> //      <li class="apple">Apple</li> //     </div> //     <li class="orange">Orange</li> //     <li class="plum">Plum</li> //   </ul>  var healthy = $('<div class="healthy"></div>') $('li').wrap(healthy)  //=> <ul id="fruits"> //     <div class="healthy"> //       <li class="apple">Apple</li> //     </div> //     <div class="healthy"> //       <li class="orange">Orange</li> //     </div> //     <div class="healthy"> //        <li class="plum">Plum</li> //     </div> //   </ul> ```  #### .css( [propertName] ) <br /> .css( [ propertyNames] ) <br /> .css( [propertyName], [value] ) <br /> .css( [propertName], [function] ) <br /> .css( [properties] )  Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements or set one or more CSS properties for every matched element.  ### Rendering When you're ready to render the document, you can use the `html` utility function:  ```js $.html() //=>  <ul id="fruits"> //      <li class="apple">Apple</li> //      <li class="orange">Orange</li> //      <li class="pear">Pear</li> //    </ul> ```  If you want to return the outerHTML you can use `$.html(selector)`:  ```js $.html('.pear') //=> <li class="pear">Pear</li> ```  By default, `html` will leave some tags open. Sometimes you may instead want to render a valid XML document. For example, you might parse the following XML snippet:  ```xml $ = cheerio.load('<media:thumbnail url="http://www.foo.com/keyframe.jpg" width="75" height="50" time="12:05:01.123"/>'); ```  ... and later want to render to XML. To do this, you can use the 'xml' utility function:  ```js $.xml() //=>  <media:thumbnail url="http://www.foo.com/keyframe.jpg" width="75" height="50" time="12:05:01.123"/> ```  You may also render the text content of a Cheerio object using the `text` static method:  ```js $ = cheerio.load('This is <em>content</em>.') $.text() //=> This is content. ```  The method may be called on the Cheerio module itself--be sure to pass a collection of nodes!  ```js $ = cheerio.load('<div>This is <em>content</em>.</div>') cheerio.text($('div')) //=> This is content. ```  ### Miscellaneous DOM element methods that don't fit anywhere else  #### .toArray() Retrieve all the DOM elements contained in the jQuery set as an array.  ```js $('li').toArray() //=> [ {...}, {...}, {...} ] ```  #### .clone() #### Clone the cheerio object.  ```js var moreFruit = $('#fruits').clone() ```  ### Utilities  #### $.root  Sometimes you need to work with the top-level root element. To query it, you can use `$.root()`.  ```js $.root().append('<ul id="vegetables"></ul>').html(); //=> <ul id="fruits">...</ul><ul id="vegetables"></ul> ```  #### $.contains( container, contained ) Checks to see if the `contained` DOM element is a descendant of the `container` DOM element.  #### $.parseHTML( data [, context ] [, keepScripts ] ) Parses a string into an array of DOM nodes. The `context` argument has no meaning for Cheerio, but it is maintained for API compatability.  #### $.load( html[, options ] ) Load in the HTML. (See the previous section titled "Loading" for more information.)  ### Plugins  Once you have loaded a document, you may extend the prototype or the equivalent `fn` property with custom plugin methods:  ```js var $ = cheerio.load('<html><body>Hello, <b>world</b>!</body></html>'); $.prototype.logHtml = function() {   console.log(this.html()); };  $('body').logHtml(); // logs "Hello, <b>world</b>!" to the console ```  ### The "DOM Node" object  Cheerio collections are made up of objects that bear some resemblence to [browser-based DOM nodes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node). You can expect them to define the following properties:  - `tagName` - `parentNode` - `previousSibling` - `nextSibling` - `nodeValue` - `firstChild` - `childNodes` - `lastChild`  ## What about JSDOM? I wrote cheerio because I found myself increasingly frustrated with JSDOM. For me, there were three main sticking points that I kept running into again and again:  __&#8226; JSDOM's built-in parser is too strict:__   JSDOM's bundled HTML parser cannot handle many popular sites out there today.  __&#8226; JSDOM is too slow:__ Parsing big websites with JSDOM has a noticeable delay.  __&#8226; JSDOM feels too heavy:__ The goal of JSDOM is to provide an identical DOM environment as what we see in the browser. I never really needed all this, I just wanted a simple, familiar way to do HTML manipulation.  ## When I would use JSDOM  Cheerio will not solve all your problems. I would still use JSDOM if I needed to work in a browser-like environment on the server, particularly if I wanted to automate functional tests.  ## Screencasts  http://vimeo.com/31950192  > This video tutorial is a follow-up to Nettut's "How to Scrape Web Pages with Node.js and jQuery", using cheerio instead of JSDOM + jQuery. This video shows how easy it is to use cheerio and how much faster cheerio is than JSDOM + jQuery.  ## Contributors  These are some of the contributors that have made cheerio possible:  ``` project  : cheerio  repo age : 2 years, 6 months  active   : 285 days  commits  : 762  files    : 36  authors  :    293  Matt Mueller            38.5%    133  Matthew Mueller         17.5%     92  Mike Pennisi            12.1%     54  David Chambers          7.1%     30  kpdecker                3.9%     19  Felix Böhm             2.5%     17  fb55                    2.2%     15  Siddharth Mahendraker   2.0%     11  Adam Bretz              1.4%      8  Nazar Leush             1.0%      7  ironchefpython          0.9%      6  Jarno Leppänen         0.8%      5  Ben Sheldon             0.7%      5  Jos Shepherd            0.7%      5  Ryan Schmukler          0.7%      5  Steven Vachon           0.7%      4  Maciej Adwent           0.5%      4  Amir Abu Shareb         0.5%      3  jeremy.dentel@brandingbrand.com 0.4%      3  Andi Neck               0.4%      2  steve                   0.3%      2  alexbardas              0.3%      2  finspin                 0.3%      2  Ali Farhadi             0.3%      2  Chris Khoo              0.3%      2  Rob Ashton              0.3%      2  Thomas Heymann          0.3%      2  Jaro Spisak             0.3%      2  Dan Dascalescu          0.3%      2  Torstein Thune          0.3%      2  Wayne Larsen            0.3%      1  Timm Preetz             0.1%      1  Xavi                    0.1%      1  Alex Shaindlin          0.1%      1  mattym                  0.1%      1  Felix Böhm            0.1%      1  Farid Neshat            0.1%      1  Dmitry Mazuro           0.1%      1  Jeremy Hubble           0.1%      1  nevermind               0.1%      1  Manuel Alabor           0.1%      1  Matt Liegey             0.1%      1  Chris O'Hara            0.1%      1  Michael Holroyd         0.1%      1  Michiel De Mey          0.1%      1  Ben Atkin               0.1%      1  Rich Trott              0.1%      1  Rob "Hurricane" Ashton  0.1%      1  Robin Gloster           0.1%      1  Simon Boudrias          0.1%      1  Sindre Sorhus           0.1%      1  xiaohwan                0.1% ```  ## Cheerio in the real world  Are you using cheerio in production? Add it to the [wiki](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio/wiki/Cheerio-in-Production)!  ## Testing  To run the test suite, download the repository, then within the cheerio directory, run:  ```shell make setup make test ```  This will download the development packages and run the test suite.  ## Special Thanks  This library stands on the shoulders of some incredible developers. A special thanks to:  __&#8226; @FB55 for node-htmlparser2 & CSSSelect:__ Felix has a knack for writing speedy parsing engines. He completely re-wrote both @tautologistic's `node-htmlparser` and @harry's `node-soupselect` from the ground up, making both of them much faster and more flexible. Cheerio would not be possible without his foundational work  __&#8226; @jQuery team for jQuery:__ The core API is the best of its class and despite dealing with all the browser inconsistencies the code base is extremely clean and easy to follow. Much of cheerio's implementation and documentation is from jQuery. Thanks guys.  __&#8226; @visionmedia:__ The style, the structure, the open-source"-ness" of this library comes from studying TJ's style and using many of his libraries. This dude consistently pumps out high-quality libraries and has always been more than willing to help or answer questions. You rock TJ.  ## License  MIT

data-uri-to-buffer ================== ### Generate a Buffer instance from a [Data URI][rfc] string [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-data-uri-to-buffer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-data-uri-to-buffer)  This module accepts a ["data" URI][rfc] String of data, and returns a node.js `Buffer` instance with the decoded data.   Installation ------------  Install with `npm`:  ``` bash $ npm install data-uri-to-buffer ```   Example -------  ``` js var dataUriToBuffer = require('data-uri-to-buffer');  // plain-text data is supported var uri = 'data:,Hello%2C%20World!'; var decoded = dataUriToBuffer(uri); console.log(decoded.toString()); // 'Hello, World!'  // base64-encoded data is supported uri = 'data:text/plain;base64,SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ%3D%3D'; decoded = dataUriToBuffer(uri); console.log(decoded.toString()); // 'Hello, World!' ```   API ---  ### dataUriToBuffer(String uri) → Buffer  The `type` property on the Buffer instance gets set to the Content-Type portion of the "mediatype" portion of the "data" URI, or defaults to `"text/plain"` if not specified.  The `charset` property on the Buffer instance gets set to the Charset portion of the "mediatype" portion of the "data" URI, or defaults to `"US-ASCII"` if not specified.

It's much faster than passing a string.  ```js const Datauri = require('datauri'), const datauri = new Datauri();  //... const buffer = fs.readFileSync('./hello'); //...  datauri.format('.png', buffer);  console.log(datauri.content); //=> "data:image/png;base64,eGtjZA==" console.log(datauri.mimetype); //=> "image/png" console.log(datauri.base64); //=> "eGtjZA==" console.log(datauri.getCSS({   class: "myClass",   width: true,   height: true })); //=> adds image width and height and custom class name  ```  ### From a string ```js const DataURI = require('datauri'); const datauri = new Datauri();  datauri.format('.png', 'xkcd');  console.log(datauri.content); //=> "data:image/png;base64,eGtjZA==" console.log(datauri.mimetype); //=> "image/png" console.log(datauri.base64); //=> "eGtjZA==" console.log(datauri.getCSS({   class: "myClass",   width: true,   height: true })); //=> adds image width and height and custom class name  ```  #### Method chaining ```js //... datauri   .on('encoded', content => {     console.log(content); //=> "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA..."     console.log(this.mimetype); //=> "image/png"     console.log(this.base64); //=> "iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA..."     console.log(this.getCSS()); //=> "\n.case {\n    background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw..."     console.log(this.getCSS({       class: "myClass"     }); //=> "\n.myClass {\n    background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw..."   })   .on('error', err => console.error(err))   .encode('test/myfile.png'); ```  DEVELOP -------  ```CLI $ npm install ```  To run test specs  ```CLI $ npm test ```  ## Requirements  Node.js 4+  ## License  MIT License (c) [Data-URI.js](http://github.com/data-uri)

degenerator =========== ### Turns sync functions into async generator functions [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-degenerator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-degenerator)  Sometimes you need to write sync looking code that's really async under the hood. This module takes a String to one or more synchronous JavaScript functions, and returns a new String that with those JS functions transpiled into ES6 Generator Functions.  So this:  ``` js function foo () {   return a('bar') || b(); } ```  Gets compiled into:  ``` js function* foo() {     return (yield a('bar')) || (yield b()); } ```  From there, you can provide asynchronous thunk-based or Generator-based implementations for the `a()` and `b()` functions, in conjunction with any Generator-based flow control library to execute the contents of the function asynchronously.   Installation ------------  Install with `npm`:  ``` bash $ npm install degenerator ```   Example -------  You must explicitly specify the names of the functions that should be "asyncified". So say we wanted to expose a `get(url)` function that did and HTTP request and returned the response body.  The user has provided us with this implementation:  ``` js function myFn () {   var one = get('https://google.com');   var two = get('http://nodejs.org');   var three = JSON.parse(get('http://jsonip.org'));   return [one, two, three]; } ```  Now we can compile this into an asyncronous generator function, implement the async `get()` function, and finally evaluate it into a real JavaScript function instance with the `vm` module:   ``` js var co = require('co'); var vm = require('vm'); var degenerator = require('degenerator');  // the `get()` function is thunk-based (error handling omitted for brevity) function get (endpoint) {   return function (fn) {     var mod = 0 == endpoint.indexOf('https:') ? require('https') : require('http');     var req = mod.get(endpoint);     req.on('response', function (res) {       var data = '';       res.setEncoding('utf8');       res.on('data', function (b) { data += b; });       res.on('end', function () {         fn(null, data);       });     });   }; }  // convert the JavaScript string provided from the user (assumed to be `str` var) str = degenerator(str, [ 'get' ]);  // at this stage, you could use a transpiler like `facebook/regenerator` // here if desired.  // turn the JS String into a real GeneratorFunction instance var genFn = vm.runInNewContext('(' + str + ')', { get: get });  // use a generator-based flow control library (`visionmedia/co`, `jmar777/suspend`, // etc.) to create an async function from the generator function.  var asnycFn = co(genFn);  // NOW USE IT!!! asyncFn(function (err, res) {   // ... }); ```   API ---  ### degenerator(String jsStr, Array functionNames) → String  Returns a "degeneratorified" JavaScript string, with ES6 Generator functions transplanted.

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5.

Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# DON'T BE A DICK PUBLIC LICENSE  > Version 1, December 2009  > Copyright (C) 2009 Philip Sturgeon <email@philsturgeon.co.uk>    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim or modified  copies of this license document, and changing it is allowed as long  as the name is changed.  > DON'T BE A DICK PUBLIC LICENSE > TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION   1. Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a dick.       Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:  	 1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name.   	 1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a dick.   	 1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick.     2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,  share the love. Only a dick would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's   creator(s) a pint.    3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes   you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick would submit the fix back.

Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS     APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

get-uri ======= ### Returns a `stream.Readable` from a URI string [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-get-uri.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-get-uri)  This high-level module accepts a URI string and returns a `Readable` stream instance. There is built-in support for a variety of "protocols", and it's easily extensible with more:  | Protocol  | Description                     | Example |:---------:|:-------------------------------:|:---------------------------------: | `data`    | [Data URIs][data]               | `data:text/plain;base64,SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ%3D%3D` | `file`    | [File URIs][file]               | `file:///c:/windows/example.ini` | `ftp`     | [FTP URIs][ftp]                 | `ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/site/README` | `http`    | [HTTP URIs][http]               | `http://www.example.com/path/to/name` | `https`   | [HTTPS URIs][https]             | `https://www.example.com/path/to/name`   Installation ------------  Install with `npm`:  ``` bash $ npm install get-uri ```   Example -------  To simply get a `stream.Readable` instance from a `file:` URI, try something like:  ``` js var getUri = require('get-uri');  // `file:` maps to a `fs.ReadStream` instance… getUri('file:///Users/nrajlich/wat.json', function (err, rs) {   if (err) throw err;   rs.pipe(process.stdout); }); ```   Missing Endpoints -----------------  When you pass in a URI in which the resource referenced does not exist on the destination server, then a `NotFoundError` will be returned. The `code` of the error instance is set to `"ENOTFOUND"`, so you can special-case that in your code to detect when a bad filename is requested:  ``` js getUri('http://example.com/resource.json', function (err, rs) {   if (err) {     if ('ENOTFOUND' == err.code) {       // bad file path requested     } else {       // something else bad happened...       throw err;     }   }    // your app code… }); ```   Cacheability ------------  When calling `getUri()` with the same URI multiple times, the `get-uri` module supports sending an indicator that the remote resource has not been modified since the last time it has been retreived from that node process.  To do this, pass in a `cache` option to the "options object" argument with the value set to the `stream.Readable` instance that was previously returned. If the remote resource has not been changed since the last call for that same URI, then a `NotModifiedError` instance will be returned with it's `code` property set to `"ENOTMODIFIED"`.  When the `"ENOTMODIFIED"` error occurs, then you can safely re-use the results from the previous `getUri()` call for that same URI:  ``` js // maps to a `fs.ReadStream` instance getUri('http://example.com/resource.json', function (err, rs) {   if (err) throw err;    // … some time later, if you need to get this same URI again, pass in the   // previous `stream.Readable` instance as `cache` option to potentially   // receive an "ENOTMODIFIED" response:   var opts = { cache: rs };   getUri('http://example.com/resource.json', opts, function (err, rs2) {     if (err) {       if ('ENOTFOUND' == err.code) {         // bad file path requested       } else if ('ENOTMODIFIED' == err.code) {         // source file has not been modified since last time it was requested,         // so `rs2` is undefined and you are expected to re-use results from         // a previous call to `getUri()`       } else {         // something else bad happened...         throw err;       }     }   }); }); ```   API ---  ### getUri(String uri[, Object options,] Function callback)  A `uri` String is required. An optional `options` object may be passed in:   - `cache` - A `stream.Readable` instance from a previous call to `getUri()` with the same URI. If this option is passed in, and the destination endpoint has not been modified, then an `ENOTMODIFIED` error is returned  Any other options passed in to the `options` object will be passed through to the low-level connection creation functions (`http.get()`, `ftp.connect()`, etc).  Invokes the given `callback` function with a `stream.Readable` instance to read the resource at the given `uri`.

=========================================

https-proxy-agent ================ ### An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS [![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/actions?workflow=Node+CI)  This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a specified HTTP or HTTPS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `https` module.  Specifically, this `Agent` implementation connects to an intermediary "proxy" server and issues the [CONNECT HTTP method][CONNECT], which tells the proxy to open a direct TCP connection to the destination server.  Since this agent implements the CONNECT HTTP method, it also works with other protocols that use this method when connecting over proxies (i.e. WebSockets). See the "Examples" section below for more.   Installation ------------  Install with `npm`:  ``` bash $ npm install https-proxy-agent ```   Examples --------  #### `https` module example  ``` js var url = require('url'); var https = require('https'); var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');  // HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128'; console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);  // HTTPS endpoint for the proxy to connect to var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'https://graph.facebook.com/tootallnate'; console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint); var options = url.parse(endpoint);  // create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(proxy); options.agent = agent;  https.get(options, function (res) {   console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);   res.pipe(process.stdout); }); ```  #### `ws` WebSocket connection example  ``` js var url = require('url'); var WebSocket = require('ws'); var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');  // HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128'; console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);  // WebSocket endpoint for the proxy to connect to var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'ws://echo.websocket.org'; var parsed = url.parse(endpoint); console.log('attempting to connect to WebSocket %j', endpoint);  // create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information var options = url.parse(proxy);  var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(options);  // finally, initiate the WebSocket connection var socket = new WebSocket(endpoint, { agent: agent });  socket.on('open', function () {   console.log('"open" event!');   socket.send('hello world'); });  socket.on('message', function (data, flags) {   console.log('"message" event! %j %j', data, flags);   socket.close(); }); ```  API ---  ### new HttpsProxyAgent(Object options)  The `HttpsProxyAgent` class implements an `http.Agent` subclass that connects to the specified "HTTP(s) proxy server" in order to proxy HTTPS and/or WebSocket requests. This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].  The `options` argument may either be a string URI of the proxy server to use, or an "options" object with more specific properties:    * `host` - String - Proxy host to connect to (may use `hostname` as well). Required.   * `port` - Number - Proxy port to connect to. Required.   * `protocol` - String - If `https:`, then use TLS to connect to the proxy.   * `headers` - Object - Additional HTTP headers to be sent on the HTTP CONNECT method.   * Any other options given are passed to the `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()` functions.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Automattic/juice.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Automattic/juice) [![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/Automattic/juice.svg)](https://david-dm.org/Automattic/juice)  # Juice ![](http://i.imgur.com/jN8Ht.gif)  Given HTML, juice will inline your CSS properties into the `style` attribute.  [Some projects using Juice](PROJECTS.md)  ## How to use  Juice has a number of functions based on whether you want to process a file, HTML string, or a cheerio document, and whether you want juice to automatically get remote stylesheets, scripts and image dataURIs to inline.  To inline HTML without getting remote resources, using default options:  ```js var juice = require('juice'); var result = juice("<style>div{color:red;}</style><div/>"); ```  result will be: ```html <div style="color: red;"></div> ```  [Try out the web client version](http://automattic.github.io/juice/)  ## What is this useful for ?  - HTML emails. For a comprehensive list of supported selectors see [here](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/) - Embedding HTML in 3rd-party websites.  ## Documentation  Juice is exposed as a standard module, and from CLI with a smaller set of options.  ### Options  All juice methods take an options object that can contain any of these properties, though not every method uses all of these:  * `applyAttributesTableElements` - whether to create attributes for styles in `juice.styleToAttribute` on elements set in `juice.tableElements`. Defaults to `true`.  * `applyHeightAttributes` - whether to use any CSS pixel heights to create `height` attributes on elements set in `juice.heightElements`. Defaults to `true`.  * `applyStyleTags` - whether to inline styles in `<style></style>` Defaults to `true`.  * `applyWidthAttributes` - whether to use any CSS pixel widths to create `width` attributes on elements set in `juice.widthElements`. Defaults to `true`.  * `extraCss` - extra css to apply to the file. Defaults to `""`.  * `insertPreservedExtraCss` - whether to insert into the document any preserved `@media` or `@font-face` content from `extraCss` when using `preserveMediaQueries`, `preserveFontFaces` or `preserveKeyFrames`. When `true` order of preference to append the `<style>` element is into `head`, then `body`, then at the end of the document. When a `string` the value is treated as a CSS/jQuery/cheerio selector, and when found, the `<style>` tag will be appended to the end of the first match. Defaults to `true`.  * `inlinePseudoElements` - Whether to insert pseudo elements (`::before` and `::after`) as `<span>` into the DOM. *Note*: Inserting pseudo elements will modify the DOM and may conflict with CSS selectors elsewhere on the page (e.g., `:last-child`).  * `preserveFontFaces` - preserves all `@font-face` within `<style></style>` tags as a refinement when `removeStyleTags` is `true`. Other styles are removed. Defaults to `true`.  * `preserveImportant` - preserves `!important` in values. Defaults to `false`.  * `preserveMediaQueries` - preserves all media queries (and contained styles) within `<style></style>` tags as a refinement when `removeStyleTags` is `true`. Other styles are removed. Defaults to `true`.  * `preserveKeyFrames` - preserves all key frames within `<style></style>` tags as a refinement when `removeStyleTags` is `true`. Other styles are removed. Defaults to `true`.  * `preservePseudos` - preserves all rules containing pseudo selectors defined in `ignoredPseudos` within `<style></style>` tags as a refinement when `removeStyleTags` is `true`. Other styles are removed. Defaults to `true`.  * `removeStyleTags` - whether to remove the original `<style></style>` tags after (possibly) inlining the css from them. Defaults to `true`.  * `webResources` - An options object that will be passed to [web-resource-inliner](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-resource-inliner) for juice functions that will get remote resources (`juiceResources` and `juiceFile`). Defaults to `{}`.  * `xmlMode` - whether to output XML/XHTML with all tags closed. Note that the input *must* also be valid XML/XHTML or you will get undesirable results. Defaults to `false`.   ### Methods  #### juice(html [, options])  Returns string containing inlined HTML. Does not fetch remote resources.   * `html` - html string, accepts complete documents as well as fragments  * `options` - optional, see Options above  #### juice.juiceResources(html, options, callback)  Callback returns string containing inlined HTML. Fetches remote resources.   * `html` - html string  * `options` - see Options above  * `callback(err, html)`    - `err` - `Error` object or `null`    - `html` - inlined HTML  #### juice.juiceFile(filePath, options, callback)  Callback returns string containing inlined HTML. Fetches remote resources.   * `filePath` - path to the html file to be juiced  * `options` - see Options above  * `callback(err, html)`    - `err` - `Error` object or `null`    - `html` - inlined HTML  #### juice.juiceDocument($ [, options])  This takes a cheerio instance and performs inlining in-place.  Returns the same cheerio instance.  Does not fetch remote resources.   * `$` - a cheerio instance, be sure to use the same cheerio version that juice uses  * `options` - optional, see Options above`  #### juice.inlineContent(html, css [, options])  This takes html and css and returns new html with the provided css inlined. It does not look at `<style>` or `<link rel="stylesheet">` elements at all.   * `html` - html string  * `css` - css string  * `options` - optional, see Options above  #### juice.inlineDocument($, css [, options])  Given a cheerio instance and css, this modifies the cheerio instance so that the provided css is inlined. It does not look at `<style>` or `<link rel="stylesheet">` elements at all.   * `$` - a cheerio instance, be sure to use the same cheerio version that juice uses  * `css` - css string  * `options` - optional, see Options above  ### Global settings  #### juice.codeBlocks  An object where each value has a `start` and `end` to specify fenced code blocks that should be ignored during parsing and inlining. For example, Handlebars (hbs) templates are `juice.codeBlocks.HBS = {start: '{{', end: '}}'}`. `codeBlocks` can fix problems where otherwise juice might interpret code like `<=` as HTML, when it is meant to be template language code. Note that `codeBlocks` is a dictionary which can contain many different code blocks, so don't do `juice.codeBlocks = {...}` do `juice.codeBlocks.myBlock = {...}`  #### juice.ignoredPseudos  Array of ignored pseudo-selectors such as 'hover' and 'active'.  #### juice.widthElements  Array of HTML elements that can receive `width` attributes.  #### juice.heightElements  Array of HTML elements that can receive `height` attributes.  #### juice.styleToAttribute  Object of style property names (key) to their respective attribute names (value).  #### juice.tableElements  Array of table HTML elements that can receive attributes defined in `juice.styleToAttribute`.  #### juice.nonVisualElements  Array of elements that will not have styles inlined because they are not intended to render.  #### juiceClient.excludedProperties  Array of css properties that won't be inlined.  ### Special markup  #### data-embed When a `data-embed` attribute is present on a stylesheet `<link>` that has been inlined into the document as a `<style></style>` tag by the web-resource-inliner juice will not inline the styles and will not remove the `<style></style>` tags.  This can be used to embed email client support hacks that rely on css selectors into your email templates.  ### CLI Options  To use Juice from CLI, run `juice [options] input.html output.html`  For a listing of all available options, just type `juice -h`.  > Note that if you want to just type `juice` from the command line, you should `npm install juice -g` so it is globally available.  CLI Options:  The CLI should have all the above [options](#options) with the names changed from camel case to hyphen-delimited, so for example `extraCss` becomes `extra-css` and `webResources.scripts` becomes `web-resources-scripts`.  These are additional options not included in the standard `juice` options listed above:  - `--css [filepath]` will load and inject CSS into `extraCss`. - `--options-file [filepath]` will load and inject options from a JSON file. Options from the CLI will be given priority over options in the file when there is a conflict. - `codeBlocks` is optionally supported in the options file if you include it. This will allow you to support different template languages in a build process.  ### Running Juice in the Browser  Attempting to Browserify `require('juice')` fails because portions of Juice and its dependencies interact with the file system using the standard `require('fs')`. However, you can `require('juice/client')` via Browserify which has support for `juiceDocument`, `inlineDocument`, and `inlineContent`, but not `juiceFile`, `juiceResources`, or `inlineExternal`. *Note that automated tests are not running in the browser yet.*  ## License  (The MIT License)  Copyright (c) 2015 Guillermo Rauch &lt;guillermo@learnboost.com&gt;  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

Copyright (c) 2011-2017 Andris Reinman  European Union Public Licence             V. 1.1  EUPL (c) the European Community 2007   This European Union Public Licence (the "EUPL") applies to the Work or Software (as defined below) which is provided under the terms of this Licence. Any use of the Work, other than as authorised under this Licence is prohibited (to the extent such use is covered by a right of the copyright holder of the Work).  The Original Work is provided under the terms of this Licence when the Licensor (as defined below) has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original Work:  Licensed under the EUPL V.1.1  or has expressed by any other mean his willingness to license under the EUPL.  1. Definitions  In this Licence, the following terms have the following meaning:  * The Licence: this Licence.  * The Original Work or the Software: the software distributed and/or communicated by the Licensor under this Licence, available as Source Code and also as Executable Code as the case may be.  * Derivative Works: the works or software that could be created by the Licensee, based upon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This Licence does not define the extent of modification or dependence on the Original Work required in order to classify a work as a Derivative Work; this extent is determined by copyright law applicable in the country mentioned in Article 15.  * The Work: the Original Work and/or its Derivative Works.  * The Source Code: the human-readable form of the Work which is the most convenient for people to study and modify.  * The Executable Code: any code which has generally been compiled and which is meant to be interpreted by a computer as a program.  * The Licensor: the natural or legal person that distributes and/or communicates the Work under the Licence.  * Contributor(s): any natural or legal person who modifies the Work under the Licence, or otherwise contributes to the creation of a Derivative Work.  * The Licensee or "You": any natural or legal person who makes any usage of the Software under the terms of the Licence.  * Distribution and/or Communication: any act of selling, giving, lending, renting, distributing, communicating, transmitting, or otherwise making available, on-line or off-line, copies of the Work or providing access to its essential functionalities at the disposal of any other natural or legal person.   2. Scope of the rights granted by the Licence  The Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable licence to do the following, for the duration of copyright vested in the Original Work:  * use the Work in any circumstance and for all usage, * reproduce the Work, * modify the Original Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the Work, * communicate to the public, including the right to make available or display the Work or copies thereof to the public and perform publicly, as the case may be, the Work, * distribute the Work or copies thereof, * lend and rent the Work or copies thereof, * sub-license rights in the Work or copies thereof.  Those rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats, whether now known or later invented, as far as the applicable law permits so.  In the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right to exercise his moral right to the extent allowed by law in order to make effective the licence of the economic rights here above listed.  The Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non exclusive usage rights to any patents held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of the rights granted on the Work under this Licence.   3. Communication of the Source Code  The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as Executable Code. If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor provides in addition a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Work along with each copy of the Work that the Licensor distributes or indicates, in a notice following the copyright notice attached to the Work, a repository where the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as the Licensor continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work.   4. Limitations on copyright  Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits from any exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners in the Original Work or Software, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable limitations thereto.   5. Obligations of the Licensee  The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following:  - Attribution right: the Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or trademarks notices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties.  The Licensee must include a copy of such notices and a copy of the Licence with every copy of the Work he/she distributes and/or communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work to carry prominent notices stating that the Work has been modified and the date of modification.  - Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes and/or communicates copies of the Original Works or Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, this Distribution and/or Communication will be done under the terms of this Licence or of a later version of this Licence unless the Original Work is expressly distributed only under this version of the Licence. The Licensee (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions on the Work or Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the Licence.  - Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes and/or Communicates Derivative Works or copies thereof based upon both the Original Work and another work licensed under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution and/or Communication can be done under the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause, "Compatible Licence" refers to the licences listed in the appendix attached to this Licence. Should the Licensee's obligations under the Compatible Licence conflict with his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the Compatible Licence shall prevail.  - Provision of Source Code: When distributing and/or communicating copies of the Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work.  Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the copyright notice.   6. Chain of Authorship  The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.  Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she brings to the Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.  Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the terms of this Licence.   7. Disclaimer of Warranty  The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or "bugs" inherent to this type of software development.  For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an "as is" basis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.  This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights to the Work.   8. Disclaimer of Liability  Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work.   9. Additional agreements  While distributing the Original Work or Derivative Works, You may choose to conclude an additional agreement to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or services consistent with this Licence. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any such warranty or additional liability.   10. Acceptance of the Licence  The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon "I agree" placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence or by affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules of applicable law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this Licence and all of its terms and conditions.  Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and conditions by exercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this Licence, such as the use of the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work or the Distribution and/or Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof.   11. Information to the public  In case of any Distribution and/or Communication of the Work by means of electronic communication by You (for example, by offering to download the Work from a remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a website) must at least provide to the public the information requested by the applicable law regarding the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be accessible, concluded, stored and reproduced by the Licensee.   12. Termination of the Licence  The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence.  Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has received the Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full compliance with the Licence.   13. Miscellaneous  Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete agreement between the Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder.  If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole. Such provision will be construed and/or reformed so as necessary to make it valid and enforceable.  The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions and/or new versions of this Licence, so far this is required and reasonable, without reducing the scope of the rights granted by the Licence. New versions of the Licence will be published with a unique version number.  All linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission, have identical value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version of their choice.   14. Jurisdiction  Any litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License, arising between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, as laid down in article 238 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.  Any litigation arising between Parties, other than the European Commission, and resulting from the interpretation of this License, will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts its primary business.   15. Applicable Law  This Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union country where the Licensor resides or has his registered office.  This licence shall be governed by the Belgian law if:  * a litigation arises between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee; * the Licensor, other than the European Commission, has no residence or registered office inside a European Union country.   Appendix  "Compatible Licences" according to article 5 EUPL are:  * GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) v. 2 * Open Software License (OSL) v. 2.1, v. 3.0 * Common Public License v. 1.0 * Eclipse Public License v. 1.0 * Cecill v. 2.0

"Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all       other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common       control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,       "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the       direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or       otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the       outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

"Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical       transformation or translation of a Source form, including but       not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,       and conversions to other media types.        "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or       Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a       copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work       (an example is provided in the Appendix below).        "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of       the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"       means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent       to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to       communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,       and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the       Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but       excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise       designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and       subsequently incorporated within the Work.     2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.     3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS     APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.        To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following       boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"       replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include       the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate       comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a       file or class name and description of purpose be included on the       same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier       identification within third-party archives.

"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and       subsequently incorporated within the Work.     2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.     3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Synopsis --------      var Netmask = require('netmask').Netmask      var block = new Netmask('10.0.0.0/12');     block.base;                     // 10.0.0.0     block.mask;                     // 255.240.0.0     block.bitmask;                  // 12     block.hostmask;                 // 0.15.255.255     block.broadcast;                // 10.15.255.255     block.size;                     // 1048576     block.first;                    // 10.0.0.1     block.last;                     // 10.15.255.254      block.contains('10.0.8.10');    // true     block.contains('10.8.0.10');    // true     block.contains('192.168.1.20'); // false      block.forEach(function(ip, long, index));      block.next()                    // Netmask('10.16.0.0/12')  Constructing ------------  Netmask objects are created with an IP address and optionally a mask. There are many forms that are recognized:      '216.240.32.0/24'               // The preferred form.     '216.240.32.0/255.255.255.0'     '216.240.32.0', '255.255.255.0'     '216.240.32.0', 0xffffff00     '216.240.32.4'                  // A /32 block.     '216.240.32'                    // A /24 block.     '216.240'                       // A /16 block.     '140'                           // A /8 block.     '216.240.32/24'     '216.240/16'  API ---  - `.base`: The base address of the network block as a string (eg: 216.240.32.0). Base does not give an indication of the size of the network block. - `.mask`: The netmask as a string (eg: 255.255.255.0). - `.hostmask`: The host mask which is the opposite of the netmask (eg: 0.0.0.255). - `.bitmask`: The netmask as a number of bits in the network portion of the address for this block (eg: 24). - `.size`: The number of IP addresses in a block (eg: 256). - `.broadcast`: The blocks broadcast address (eg: 192.168.1.0/24 => 192.168.1.255) - `.first`, `.last`: First and last useable address - `.contains(ip or block)`: Returns a true if the IP number `ip` is part of the network. That is, a true value is returned if `ip` is between `base` and `broadcast`. If a Netmask object or a block is given, it returns true only of the given block fits inside the network. - `.forEach(fn)`: Similar to the Array prototype method. It loops through all the useable addresses, ie between `first` and `last`. - `.next(count)`: Without a `count`, return the next block of the same size after the current one. With a count, return the Nth block after the current one. A count of -1 returns the previous block. Undef will be returned if out of legal address space. - `.toString()`: The netmask in base/bitmask format (e.g., '216.240.32.0/24')  Installation ------------      $ npm install netmask  License -------  (The MIT License)  Copyright (c) 2011 Olivier Poitrey <rs@dailymotion.com>  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a dick.       Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:  	 1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name.   	 1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a dick.   	 1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick.     2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,  share the love. Only a dick would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's   creator(s) a pint.    3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes   you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick would submit the fix back.

pac-proxy-agent =============== ### A [PAC file][pac-wikipedia] proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-pac-proxy-agent.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-pac-proxy-agent)  This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that retreives the specified [PAC proxy file][pac-wikipedia] and uses it to resolve which HTTP, HTTPS, or SOCKS proxy, or if a direct connection should be used to connect to the HTTP endpoint.  It is designed to be be used with the built-in `http` and `https` modules.   Installation ------------  Install with `npm`:  ``` bash $ npm install pac-proxy-agent ```   Example -------  ``` js var url = require('url'); var http = require('http'); var PacProxyAgent = require('pac-proxy-agent');  // URI to a PAC proxy file to use (the "pac+" prefix is stripped) var proxy = 'pac+https://cloudup.com/ceGH2yZ0Bjp+'; console.log('using PAC proxy proxy file at %j', proxy);  // HTTP endpoint for the proxy to connect to var endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/'; console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint); var opts = url.parse(endpoint);  // create an instance of the `PacProxyAgent` class with the PAC file location var agent = new PacProxyAgent(proxy); opts.agent = agent;  http.get(opts, function (res) {   console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);   res.pipe(process.stdout); }); ```   License -------  (The MIT License)  Copyright (c) 2014 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

pac-resolver ============ ### Generates an asynchronous resolver function from a [PAC file][pac-wikipedia] [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-pac-resolver.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-pac-resolver)   This module accepts a JavaScript String of code, which is meant to be a [PAC proxy file][pac-wikipedia], and returns a generated asynchronous `FindProxyForURL()` function.   Installation ------------  Install with `npm`:  ``` bash $ npm install pac-resolver ```   Example -------  Given the PAC proxy file named `proxy.pac`:  ``` js function FindProxyForURL(url, host) {   if (isInNet(myIpAddress(), "10.1.10.0", "255.255.255.0")) {     return "PROXY 1.2.3.4:8080";   } else {     return "DIRECT";   } } ```  You can consume this PAC file with `pac-resolver` like so:  ``` js var fs = require('fs'); var pac = require('pac-resolver');  var FindProxyForURL = pac(fs.readFileSync('proxy.pac'));  FindProxyForURL('http://foo.com/').then((res) => {   console.log(res);   // "DIRECT" }); ```   API ---  ### pac(String jsStr[, Object options]) → Function  Returns an asynchronous `FindProxyForURL()` function based off of the given JS string `jsStr` PAC proxy file. An optional `options` object may be passed in which respects the following options:   * `filename` - String - the filename to use in error stack traces. Defaults to `proxy.pac`.  * `sandbox` - Object - a map of functions to include in the sandbox of the  JavaScript environment where the JS code will be executed. i.e. if you wanted to  include the common `alert` function you could pass `alert: console.log`. For  async functions, you must set the `async = true` property on the function  instance, and the JS code will be able to invoke the function as if it were  synchronous.

proxy-agent =========== ### Maps proxy protocols to `http.Agent` implementations [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-proxy-agent.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-proxy-agent)  This module provides a function that returns proxying `http.Agent` instances to use based off of a given proxy URI.  An LRU cache is used so that `http.Agent` instances are transparently re-used for subsequent HTTP requests to the same proxy server.  The currently implemented protocol mappings are listed in the table below:   | Protocol   | Proxy Agent for `http` requests | Proxy Agent for `https` requests | Example |:----------:|:-------------------------------:|:--------------------------------:|:--------: | `http`     | [http-proxy-agent][]            | [https-proxy-agent][]            | `http://proxy-server-over-tcp.com:3128` | `https`    | [http-proxy-agent][]            | [https-proxy-agent][]            | `https://proxy-server-over-tls.com:3129` | `socks(v5)`| [socks-proxy-agent][]           | [socks-proxy-agent][]            | `socks://username:password@some-socks-proxy.com:9050` (username & password are optional) | `socks5`   | [socks-proxy-agent][]           | [socks-proxy-agent][]            | `socks5://username:password@some-socks-proxy.com:9050` (username & password are optional) | `socks4`   | [socks-proxy-agent][]           | [socks-proxy-agent][]            | `socks4://some-socks-proxy.com:9050` | `pac`      | [pac-proxy-agent][]             | [pac-proxy-agent][]              | `pac+http://www.example.com/proxy.pac`   Installation ------------  Install with `npm`:  ``` bash $ npm install proxy-agent ```   Example -------  ``` js var http = require('http'); var ProxyAgent = require('proxy-agent');  // HTTP, HTTPS, or SOCKS proxy to use var proxyUri = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.43.102:3128';  var opts = {   method: 'GET',   host: 'jsonip.org',   path: '/',   // this is the important part!   agent: new ProxyAgent(proxyUri) };  // the rest works just like any other normal HTTP request http.get(opts, onresponse);  function onresponse (res) {   console.log(res.statusCode, res.headers);   res.pipe(process.stdout); } ```   API ---  ### new ProxyAgent(Object|String opts|uri)  Returns an `http.Agent` instance based off of the given proxy `opts` or URI string. An LRU cache is used, so the same `http.Agent` instance will be returned if identical args are passed in.

# proxy-from-env  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Rob--W/proxy-from-env.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Rob--W/proxy-from-env) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/Rob--W/proxy-from-env/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/Rob--W/proxy-from-env?branch=master)  `proxy-from-env` is a Node.js package that exports a function (`getProxyForUrl`) that takes an input URL (a string or [`url.parse`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/url.html#url_url_parsing)'s return value) and returns the desired proxy URL (also a string) based on standard proxy environment variables. If no proxy is set, an empty string is returned.  It is your responsibility to actually proxy the request using the given URL.  Installation:  ```sh npm install proxy-from-env ```  ## Example This example shows how the data for a URL can be fetched via the [`http` module](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html), in a proxy-aware way.  ```javascript var http = require('http'); var parseUrl = require('url').parse; var getProxyForUrl = require('proxy-from-env').getProxyForUrl;  var some_url = 'http://example.com/something';  // // Example, if there is a proxy server at 10.0.0.1:1234, then setting the // // http_proxy environment variable causes the request to go through a proxy. // process.env.http_proxy = 'http://10.0.0.1:1234'; //  // // But if the host to be proxied is listed in NO_PROXY, then the request is // // not proxied (but a direct request is made). // process.env.no_proxy = 'example.com';  var proxy_url = getProxyForUrl(some_url);  // <-- Our magic. if (proxy_url) {   // Should be proxied through proxy_url.   var parsed_some_url = parseUrl(some_url);   var parsed_proxy_url = parseUrl(proxy_url);   // A HTTP proxy is quite simple. It is similar to a normal request, except the   // path is an absolute URL, and the proxied URL's host is put in the header   // instead of the server's actual host.   httpOptions = {     protocol: parsed_proxy_url.protocol,     hostname: parsed_proxy_url.hostname,     port: parsed_proxy_url.port,     path: parsed_some_url.href,     headers: {       Host: parsed_some_url.host,  // = host name + optional port.     },   }; } else {   // Direct request.   httpOptions = some_url; } http.get(httpOptions, function(res) {   var responses = [];   res.on('data', function(chunk) { responses.push(chunk); });   res.on('end', function() { console.log(responses.join(''));  }); });  ```  ## Environment variables The environment variables can be specified in lowercase or uppercase, with the lowercase name having precedence over the uppercase variant. A variable that is not set has the same meaning as a variable that is set but has no value.  ### NO\_PROXY  `NO_PROXY` is a list of host names (optionally with a port). If the input URL matches any of the entries in `NO_PROXY`, then the input URL should be fetched by a direct request (i.e. without a proxy).  Matching follows the following rules:  - `NO_PROXY=*` disables all proxies. - Space and commas may be used to separate the entries in the `NO_PROXY` list. - If `NO_PROXY` does not contain any entries, then proxies are never disabled. - If a port is added after the host name, then the ports must match. If the URL   does not have an explicit port name, the protocol's default port is used. - Generally, the proxy is only disabled if the host name is an exact match for   an entry in the `NO_PROXY` list. The only exceptions are entries that start   with a dot or with a wildcard; then the proxy is disabled if the host name   ends with the entry.  See `test.js` for examples of what should match and what does not.  ### \*\_PROXY  The environment variable used for the proxy depends on the protocol of the URL. For example, `https://example.com` uses the "https" protocol, and therefore the proxy to be used is `HTTPS_PROXY` (_NOT_ `HTTP_PROXY`, which is _only_ used for http:-URLs).  The library is not limited to http(s), other schemes such as `FTP_PROXY` (ftp:), `WSS_PROXY` (wss:), `WS_PROXY` (ws:) are also supported.  If present, `ALL_PROXY` is used as fallback if there is no other match.   ## External resources The exact way of parsing the environment variables is not codified in any standard. This library is designed to be compatible with formats as expected by existing software. The following resources were used to determine the desired behavior:  - cURL:   https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html#ENVIRONMENT     https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/4af40b3646d3b09f68e419f7ca866ff395d1f897/lib/url.c#L4446-L4514     https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/4af40b3646d3b09f68e419f7ca866ff395d1f897/lib/url.c#L4608-L4638    - wget:    https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html#Proxies     http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/wget.git/tree/src/init.c?id=636a5f9a1c508aa39e35a3a8e9e54520a284d93d#n383     http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/wget.git/tree/src/retr.c?id=93c1517c4071c4288ba5a4b038e7634e4c6b5482#n1278    - W3:   https://www.w3.org/Daemon/User/Proxies/ProxyClients.html    - Python's urllib:   https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/936135bb97fe04223aa30ca6e98eac8f3ed6b349/Lib/urllib/request.py#L755-L782     https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/936135bb97fe04223aa30ca6e98eac8f3ed6b349/Lib/urllib/request.py#L2444-L2479

# Slick  Slick is a standalone selector engine that is totally slick. Slick is split in 2 components: the Finder and the Parser. The Finder's job is to find nodes on a webpage, the Parser's job is to create a javascript object representation of any css selector.  Slick allows you to:   * Create your own custom pseudo-classes  * Use the Parser by itself.  * Find nodes in XML documents.   ---  ## The Finder  Find nodes in the DOM  ### `search` context for selector  Search this context for any nodes that match this selector.  Expects: * selector: String or SelectorObject * (**optional**) context: document or node or array of documents or nodes * (**optional**) append: Array or Object with a push method  Returns: append argument or Array of 0 or more nodes  	slick.search("#foo > bar.baz") → [<bar>, <bar>, <bar>] 	slick.search("li > a", [<ol>, <ul>]) → [<a>, <a>, <a>] 	slick.search("#foo > bar.baz", document, []) → [<bar>, <bar>, <bar>]  ### `find` first in context with selector or null  Find the first node in document that matches selector or null if none are found.  Expects: * selector: String or SelectorObject * (**optional**) context: document or node or array of documents or nodes  Returns: Element or null  	slick.find("#foo > bar.baz") → <bar> 	slick.find("#does-not-exist", node) → null  ### node `matches` selector?  Does this node match this selector?  Expects: * node * node, String or SelectorObject  Returns: true or false  	slick.matches(<div class=rocks>, "div.rocks") → true 	slick.matches(<div class=lame>, "div.rocks") → false 	slick.matches(<div class=lame>, <div class=rocks>) → false  ### context `contains` node?  Does this context contain this node? Is the context a parent of this node?  Expects: * context: document or node * node: node  Returns: true or false  	slick.contains(<ul>, <li>) → true 	slick.contains(<body>, <html>) → false  ---  ## The Parser  Parse a CSS selector string into a JavaScript object  ### `parse` selector into object  Parse a CSS Selector String into a Selector Object.  Expects: String  Returns: SelectorObject  	slick.parse("#foo > bar.baz") → SelectorObject   ### format  ### `#foo > bar.baz`  	[[ 		{ "combinator":" ", "tag":"*", "id":"foo" }, 		{ "combinator":">", "tag":"bar", "classList": ["baz"], "classes": [{"value":"baz", "match": RegExp }]} 	]]  ### `h1, h2, ul > li, .things`  	[ 		[{ "combinator":" ", "tag": "h1" }], 		[{ "combinator":" ", "tag": "h2" }], 		[{ "combinator":" ", "tag": "ul" }, { "combinator": ">", "tag": "li" }], 		[{ "combinator":" ", "tag": "*", "classList": ["things"], "classes": [{"value": "things", "match": RegExp }] }] 	]

socks-proxy-agent ================ ### A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent)  This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a specified SOCKS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `http` or `https` modules.  It can also be used in conjunction with the `ws` module to establish a WebSocket connection over a SOCKS proxy. See the "Examples" section below.  Installation ------------  Install with `npm`:  ``` bash $ npm install socks-proxy-agent ```   Examples --------  #### `http` module example  ``` js var url = require('url'); var http = require('http'); var SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');  // SOCKS proxy to connect to var proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:9050'; console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);  // HTTP endpoint for the proxy to connect to var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'http://nodejs.org/api/'; console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint); var opts = url.parse(endpoint);  // create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information var agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy); opts.agent = agent;  http.get(opts, function (res) {   console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);   res.pipe(process.stdout); }); ```  #### `https` module example  ``` js var url = require('url'); var https = require('https'); var SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');  // SOCKS proxy to connect to var proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:9050'; console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);  // HTTP endpoint for the proxy to connect to var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'https://encrypted.google.com/'; console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint); var opts = url.parse(endpoint);  // create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information var agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy); opts.agent = agent;  https.get(opts, function (res) {   console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);   res.pipe(process.stdout); }); ```  #### `ws` WebSocket connection example  ``` js var WebSocket = require('ws'); var SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');  // SOCKS proxy to connect to var proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:9050'; console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);  // WebSocket endpoint for the proxy to connect to var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'ws://echo.websocket.org'; console.log('attempting to connect to WebSocket %j', endpoint);  // create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information var agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy);  // initiate the WebSocket connection var socket = new WebSocket(endpoint, { agent: agent });  socket.on('open', function () {   console.log('"open" event!');   socket.send('hello world'); });  socket.on('message', function (data, flags) {   console.log('"message" event! %j %j', data, flags);   socket.close(); }); ```  License -------  (The MIT License)  Copyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

strftime ========  strftime for JavaScript. Works in (at least) node.js and browsers. Supports localization and timezones. Most standard specifiers from C are supported as well as some other extensions from Ruby.  [![version 0.10.0 on npm](https://img.shields.io/badge/npm-0.10.0-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/strftime) [![node version 0.2 and up](https://img.shields.io/badge/node->=0.2-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://nodejs.org) [![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg?style=flat)](https://sjs.mit-license.org)  Installation ============  [node](https://nodejs.org):      npm install strftime  [bower](http://bower.io):      bower install strftime  [component](https://github.com/componentjs/component):      component install samsonjs/strftime  [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):      yarn add strftime  Or you can copy [strftime.js](https://github.com/samsonjs/strftime/blob/master/strftime.js) wherever you want to use it, whether that's with a &lt;script&gt; tag or `require` or anything else.  Usage =====  ```JavaScript     var strftime = require('strftime') // not required in browsers     console.log(strftime('%B %d, %Y %H:%M:%S')) // => April 28, 2011 18:21:08     console.log(strftime('%F %T', new Date(1307472705067))) // => 2011-06-07 18:51:45 ```   If you want to localize it:  ```JavaScript     var strftime = require('strftime') // not required in browsers     var it_IT = {         days: ['domenica', 'lunedi', 'martedi', 'mercoledi', 'giovedi', 'venerdi', 'sabato'],         shortDays: ['dom', 'lun', 'mar', 'mer', 'gio', 'ven', 'sab'],         months: ['gennaio', 'febbraio', 'marzo', 'aprile', 'maggio', 'giugno', 'luglio', 'agosto', 'settembre', 'ottobre', 'novembre', 'dicembre'],         shortMonths: ['gen', 'feb', 'mar', 'apr', 'mag', 'giu', 'lug', 'ago', 'set', 'ott', 'nov', 'dic'],         AM: 'AM',         PM: 'PM',         am: 'am',         pm: 'pm',         formats: {             D: '%m/%d/%y',             F: '%Y-%m-%d',             R: '%H:%M',             X: '%T',             c: '%a %b %d %X %Y',             r: '%I:%M:%S %p',             T: '%H:%M:%S',             v: '%e-%b-%Y',             x: '%D'         }     }     var strftimeIT = strftime.localize(it_IT)     console.log(strftimeIT('%B %d, %Y %H:%M:%S')) // => aprile 28, 2011 18:21:08     console.log(strftimeIT('%B %d, %Y %H:%M:%S', new Date(1307472705067))) // => giugno 7, 2011 18:51:45 ```  Some locales are bundled and can be used like so:  ```JavaScript     var strftime = require('strftime') // not required in browsers     var strftimeIT = strftime.localizeByIdentifier('it_IT')     console.log(strftimeIT('%B %d, %Y %H:%M:%S')) // => aprile 28, 2011 18:21:08     console.log(strftimeIT('%B %d, %Y %H:%M:%S', new Date(1307472705067))) // => giugno 7, 2011 18:51:45 ```  _The [full list of bundled locales](#locales) is below._  Time zones can be passed in as an offset from GMT in minutes.  ```JavaScript     var strftime = require('strftime') // not required in browsers     var strftimePDT = strftime.timezone(-420)     var strftimeCEST = strftime.timezone(120)     console.log(strftimePDT('%B %d, %y %H:%M:%S', new Date(1307472705067))) // => June 07, 11 11:51:45     console.log(strftimeCEST('%F %T', new Date(1307472705067))) // => 2011-06-07 20:51:45 ```  Alternatively you can use the timezone format used by ISO 8601, `+HHMM` or `-HHMM`.  ```JavaScript     var strftime = require('strftime') // not required in browsers     var strftimePDT = strftime.timezone('-0700')     var strftimeCEST = strftime.timezone('+0200')     console.log(strftimePDT('%F %T', new Date(1307472705067))) // => 2011-06-07 11:51:45     console.log(strftimeCEST('%F %T', new Date(1307472705067))) // => 2011-06-07 20:51:45 ```  Supported Specifiers ====================  Extensions from Ruby are noted in the following list.  Unsupported specifiers are rendered without the percent sign. e.g. `%q` becomes `q`. Use `%%` to get a literal `%` sign.  - A: full weekday name - a: abbreviated weekday name - B: full month name - b: abbreviated month name - C: AD century (year / 100), padded to 2 digits - c: equivalent to `%a %b %d %X %Y %Z` in en_US (based on locale) - D: equivalent to `%m/%d/%y` in en_US (based on locale) - d: day of the month, padded to 2 digits (01-31) - e: day of the month, padded with a leading space for single digit values (1-31) - F: equivalent to `%Y-%m-%d` in en_US (based on locale) - H: the hour (24-hour clock), padded to 2 digits (00-23) - h: the same as %b (abbreviated month name) - I: the hour (12-hour clock), padded to 2 digits (01-12) - j: day of the year, padded to 3 digits (001-366) - k: the hour (24-hour clock), padded with a leading space for single digit values (0-23) - L: the milliseconds, padded to 3 digits [Ruby extension] - l: the hour (12-hour clock), padded with a leading space for single digit values (1-12) - M: the minute, padded to 2 digits (00-59) - m: the month, padded to 2 digits (01-12) - n: newline character - o: day of the month as an ordinal (without padding), e.g. 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, ... - P: "am" or "pm" in lowercase (Ruby extension, based on locale) - p: "AM" or "PM" (based on locale) - R: equivalent to `%H:%M` in en_US (based on locale) - r: equivalent to `%I:%M:%S %p` in en_US (based on locale) - S: the second, padded to 2 digits (00-60) - s: the number of seconds since the Epoch, UTC - T: equivalent to `%H:%M:%S` in en_US (based on locale) - t: tab character - U: week number of the year, Sunday as the first day of the week, padded to 2 digits (00-53) - u: the weekday, Monday as the first day of the week (1-7) - v: equivalent to `%e-%b-%Y` in en_US (based on locale) - W: week number of the year, Monday as the first day of the week, padded to 2 digits (00-53) - w: the weekday, Sunday as the first day of the week (0-6) - X: equivalent to `%D` in en_US (based on locale) - x: equivalent to `%T` in en_US (based on locale) - Y: the year with the century - y: the year without the century (00-99) - Z: the time zone name, replaced with an empty string if it is not found - z: the time zone offset from UTC, with a leading plus sign for UTC and zones east      of UTC and a minus sign for those west of UTC, hours and minutes follow each      padded to 2 digits and with no delimiter between them  For more detail see `man 3 strftime` as the format specifiers should behave identically. If behaviour differs please [file a bug](https://github.com/samsonjs/strftime/issues/new).  Any specifier can be modified with `-`, `_`, `0`, or `:` as well, as in Ruby. Using `%-` will omit any leading zeroes or spaces, `%_` will force spaces for padding instead of the default, and `%0` will force zeroes for padding. There's some redundancy here as `%-d` and `%e` have the same result, but it solves some awkwardness with formats like `%l`. Using `%:` for time zone offset, as in `%:z` will insert a colon as a delimiter.  <a name="locales"></a> Bundled Locales ===============    - de\_DE   - en\_CA   - en\_US   - es\_MX   - fr\_FR   - it\_IT   - nl\_NL   - pt\_BR   - ru\_RU   - tr\_TR   - zh\_CN  Contributors ============  * [Alexandr Nikitin](https://github.com/alexandrnikitin) * [Andrew Pirondini](https://github.com/andrewjpiro) of [iFixit](https://github.com/iFixit) * [Andrew Schaaf](https://github.com/andrewschaaf) * [Ayman Nedjmeddine](https://github.com/IOAyman) * [Cory Heslip](https://github.com/cheslip) * [Forbes Lindesay](https://github.com/ForbesLindesay) * [John Zwinck](https://github.com/jzwinck) * [Joost Hietbrink](https://github.com/joost) * [Kevin Jin](https://github.com/Kevin-Jin) * [Michael J.](https://github.com/michaeljayt) * [Peter deHaan](https://github.com/pdehaan) * [Rob Colburn](https://github.com/robcolburn) * [Ryan Regalado](https://github.com/d48) * [Ryan Stafford](https://github.com/ryanstafford) * [Sami Samhuri](https://github.com/samsonjs) * [Stian Grytøyr](https://github.com/stiang) * [TJ Holowaychuk](https://github.com/tj) * [w0den](https://github.com/w0den)   License =======  Copyright 2010 - 2016 Sami Samhuri sami@samhuri.net  [MIT license](https://sjs.mit-license.org)

Installation ------------  Install with `npm`:  ``` bash $ npm install superagent-proxy ```   Example -------  ``` js var request = require('superagent');  // extend with Request#proxy() require('superagent-proxy')(request);  // HTTP, HTTPS, or SOCKS proxy to use var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.43.102:3128';  request   .get(process.argv[2] || 'https://encrypted.google.com/')   .proxy(proxy)   .end(onresponse);  function onresponse (err, res) {   if (err) {     console.log(err);   } else {     console.log(res.status, res.headers);     console.log(res.body);   } } ```   License -------  (The MIT License)  Copyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:  You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and  You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and  You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and  If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.

Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.  7.

%% uri-js@4.2.2 NOTICES AND INFORMATION BEGIN HERE:
=========================================

# URI.js  URI.js is an [RFC 3986](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt) compliant, scheme extendable URI parsing/validating/resolving library for all JavaScript environments (browsers, Node.js, etc). It is also compliant with the IRI ([RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt)), IDNA ([RFC 5890](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5890.txt)), IPv6 Address ([RFC 5952](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5952.txt)), IPv6 Zone Identifier ([RFC 6874](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6874.txt)) specifications.  URI.js has an extensive test suite, and works in all (Node.js, web) environments. It weighs in at 6.2kb (gzipped, 16kb deflated).  ## API  ### Parsing  	URI.parse("uri://user:pass@example.com:123/one/two.three?q1=a1&q2=a2#body"); 	//returns: 	//{ 	//  scheme : "uri", 	//  userinfo : "user:pass", 	//  host : "example.com", 	//  port : 123, 	//  path : "/one/two.three", 	//  query : "q1=a1&q2=a2", 	//  fragment : "body" 	//}  ### Serializing  	URI.serialize({scheme : "http", host : "example.com", fragment : "footer"}) === "http://example.com/#footer"  ### Resolving  	URI.resolve("uri://a/b/c/d?q", "../../g") === "uri://a/g"  ### Normalizing  	URI.normalize("HTTP://ABC.com:80/%7Esmith/home.html") === "http://abc.com/~smith/home.html"  ### Comparison  	URI.equal("example://a/b/c/%7Bfoo%7D", "eXAMPLE://a/./b/../b/%63/%7bfoo%7d") === true  ### IP Support  	//IPv4 normalization 	URI.normalize("//192.068.001.000") === "//192.68.1.0"  	//IPv6 normalization 	URI.normalize("//[2001:0:0DB8::0:0001]") === "//[2001:0:db8::1]"  	//IPv6 zone identifier support 	URI.parse("//[2001:db8::7%25en1]"); 	//returns: 	//{ 	//  host : "2001:db8::7%en1" 	//}  ### IRI Support  	//convert IRI to URI 	URI.serialize(URI.parse("http://examplé.org/rosé")) === "http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9" 	//convert URI to IRI 	URI.serialize(URI.parse("http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9"), {iri:true}) === "http://examplé.org/rosé"  ### Options  All of the above functions can accept an additional options argument that is an object that can contain one or more of the following properties:  *	`scheme` (string)  	Indicates the scheme that the URI should be treated as, overriding the URI's normal scheme parsing behavior.  *	`reference` (string)  	If set to `"suffix"`, it indicates that the URI is in the suffix format, and the validator will use the option's `scheme` property to determine the URI's scheme.  *	`tolerant` (boolean, false)  	If set to `true`, the parser will relax URI resolving rules.  *	`absolutePath` (boolean, false)  	If set to `true`, the serializer will not resolve a relative `path` component.  *	`iri` (boolean, false)  	If set to `true`, the serializer will unescape non-ASCII characters as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).  *	`unicodeSupport` (boolean, false)  	If set to `true`, the parser will unescape non-ASCII characters in the parsed output as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).  *	`domainHost` (boolean, false)  	If set to `true`, the library will treat the `host` component as a domain name, and convert IDNs (International Domain Names) as per [RFC 5891](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5891.txt).  ## Scheme Extendable  URI.js supports inserting custom [scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme) dependent processing rules. Currently, URI.js has built in support for the following schemes:  *	http \[[RFC 2616](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt)\] *	https \[[RFC 2818](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2818.txt)\] *	mailto \[[RFC 6068](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6068.txt)\] *	urn \[[RFC 2141](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt)\] *	urn:uuid \[[RFC 4122](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt)\]  ### HTTP Support  	URI.equal("HTTP://ABC.COM:80", "http://abc.com/") === true  ### Mailto Support  	URI.parse("mailto:alpha@example.com,bravo@example.com?subject=SUBSCRIBE&body=Sign%20me%20up!"); 	//returns: 	//{ 	//	scheme : "mailto", 	//	to : ["alpha@example.com", "bravo@example.com"], 	//	subject : "SUBSCRIBE", 	//	body : "Sign me up!" 	//}  	URI.serialize({ 		scheme : "mailto", 		to : ["alpha@example.com"], 		subject : "REMOVE", 		body : "Please remove me", 		headers : { 			cc : "charlie@example.com" 		} 	}) === "mailto:alpha@example.com?cc=charlie@example.com&subject=REMOVE&body=Please%20remove%20me"  ### URN Support  	URI.parse("urn:example:foo"); 	//returns: 	//{ 	//	scheme : "urn", 	//	nid : "example", 	//	nss : "foo", 	//}  #### URN UUID Support  	URI.parse("urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6"); 	//returns: 	//{ 	//	scheme : "urn", 	//	nid : "example", 	//	uuid : "f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6", 	//}  ## Usage  To load in a browser, use the following tag:  	<script type="text/javascript" src="uri-js/dist/es5/uri.all.min.js"></script>  To load in a CommonJS (Node.js) environment, first install with npm by running on the command line:  	npm install uri-js  Then, in your code, load it using:  	const URI = require("uri-js");  If you are writing your code in ES6+ (ESNEXT) or TypeScript, you would load it using:  	import * as URI from "uri-js";  Or you can load just what you need using named exports:  	import { parse, serialize, resolve, resolveComponents, normalize, equal, removeDotSegments, pctEncChar, pctDecChars, escapeComponent, unescapeComponent } from "uri-js";  ## Breaking changes  ### Breaking changes from 3.x  URN parsing has been completely changed to better align with the specification. Scheme is now always `urn`, but has two new properties: `nid` which contains the Namspace Identifier, and `nss` which contains the Namespace Specific String. The `nss` property will be removed by higher order scheme handlers, such as the UUID URN scheme handler.  The UUID of a URN can now be found in the `uuid` property.  ### Breaking changes from 2.x  URI validation has been removed as it was slow, exposed a vulnerabilty, and was generally not useful.  ### Breaking changes from 1.x  The `errors` array on parsed components is now an `error` string.  ## License ([Simplified BSD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses#2-clause))  Copyright 2011 Gary Court.

If You       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

=========================================

[XRegExp](http://xregexp.com/) ==============================  XRegExp provides augmented, extensible, cross-browser JavaScript regular expressions. You get new syntax and flags beyond what browsers support natively, along with a collection of utils to make your client-side grepping and parsing easier. XRegExp also frees you from worrying about pesky inconsistencies in cross-browser regex handling and the dubious `lastIndex` property.  XRegExp supports all native ES5 regular expression syntax. It's about 3.5 KB when minified and gzipped. It works with Internet Explorer 5.5+, Firefox 1.5+, Chrome, Safari 3+, and Opera 9.5+.   ## Performance  XRegExp regular expressions compile to native RegExp objects, thus there is no performance difference when using XRegExp objects with native methods. There is a small performance cost when *compiling* XRegExps. If you want, however, you can use `XRegExp.cache` to avoid ever incurring the compilation cost for a given pattern more than once. Doing so can even lead to XRegExp being faster than native regexes in synthetic tests that repeatedly compile the same regex.   ## Usage examples  ~~~ js // Using named capture and flag x (free-spacing and line comments) var date = XRegExp('(?<year>  [0-9]{4}) -?  # year  \n\                     (?<month> [0-9]{2}) -?  # month \n\                     (?<day>   [0-9]{2})     # day   ', 'x');  // XRegExp.exec gives you named backreferences on the match result var match = XRegExp.exec('2012-02-22', date); match.day; // -> '22'  // It also includes optional pos and sticky arguments var pos = 3, result = []; while (match = XRegExp.exec('<1><2><3><4>5<6>', /<(\d+)>/, pos, 'sticky')) {     result.push(match[1]);     pos = match.index + match[0].length; } // result -> ['2', '3', '4']  // XRegExp.replace allows named backreferences in replacements XRegExp.replace('2012-02-22', date, '${month}/${day}/${year}'); // -> '02/22/2012' XRegExp.replace('2012-02-22', date, function (match) {     return match.month + '/' + match.day + '/' + match.year; }); // -> '02/22/2012'  // In fact, all XRegExps are RegExps and work perfectly with native methods date.test('2012-02-22'); // -> true  // The *only* caveat is that named captures must be referred to using numbered backreferences '2012-02-22'.replace(date, '$2/$3/$1'); // -> '02/22/2012'  // If you want, you can extend native methods so you don't have to worry about this // Doing so also fixes numerous browser bugs in the native methods XRegExp.install('natives'); '2012-02-22'.replace(date, '${month}/${day}/${year}'); // -> '02/22/2012' '2012-02-22'.replace(date, function (match) {     return match.month + '/' + match.day + '/' + match.year; }); // -> '02/22/2012' date.exec('2012-02-22').day; // -> '22'  // Extract every other digit from a string using XRegExp.forEach XRegExp.forEach('1a2345', /\d/, function (match, i) {     if (i % 2) this.push(+match[0]); }, []); // -> [2, 4]  // Get numbers within <b> tags using XRegExp.matchChain XRegExp.matchChain('1 <b>2</b> 3 <b>4 a 56</b>', [     XRegExp('(?is)<b>.*?</b>'),     /\d+/ ]); // -> ['2', '4', '56']  // You can also pass forward and return specific backreferences var html = '<a href="http://xregexp.com/">XRegExp</a>\             <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>'; XRegExp.matchChain(html, [     {regex: /<a href="([^"]+)">/i, backref: 1},     {regex: XRegExp('(?i)^https?://(?<domain>[^/?#]+)'), backref: 'domain'} ]); // -> ['xregexp.com', 'www.google.com']  // XRegExp.union safely merges strings and regexes into a single pattern XRegExp.union(['a+b*c', /(dogs)\1/, /(cats)\1/], 'i'); // -> /a\+b\*c|(dogs)\1|(cats)\2/i ~~~  These examples should give you the flavor of what's possible, but XRegExp has more syntax, flags, utils, options, and browser fixes that aren't shown here. You can even augment XRegExp's regular expression syntax with addons (see below) or write your own. See [xregexp.com](http://xregexp.com/) for more details.   ## Addons  In browsers, you can either load addons individually, or bundle all addons together with XRegExp by loading `xregexp-all.js`. XRegExp's [npm](http://npmjs.org/) package uses `xregexp-all.js`, which means that the addons are always available when XRegExp is installed on the server using npm.   ### XRegExp Unicode Base  In browsers, first include the Unicode Base script:  ~~~ html <script src="xregexp.js"></script> <script src="addons/unicode/unicode-base.js"></script> ~~~  Then you can do this:  ~~~ js var unicodeWord = XRegExp('^\\p{L}+$'); unicodeWord.test('Русский'); // -> true unicodeWord.test('日本語'); // -> true unicodeWord.test('العربية'); // -> true ~~~  The base script adds `\p{Letter}` and its alias `\p{L}`, but other Unicode categories, scripts, blocks, and properties require addon packages. Try these next examples after additionally including `unicode-scripts.js`:  ~~~ js XRegExp('^\\p{Hiragana}+$').test('ひらがな'); // -> true XRegExp('^[\\p{Latin}\\p{Common}]+$').test('Über Café.'); // -> true ~~~  XRegExp uses the Unicode 6.1 Basic Multilingual Plane.   ### XRegExp.build  In browsers, first include the script:  ~~~ html <script src="xregexp.js"></script> <script src="addons/build.js"></script> ~~~  You can then build regular expressions using named subpatterns, for readability and pattern reuse:  ~~~ js var time = XRegExp.build('(?x)^ {{hours}} ({{minutes}}) $', {     hours: XRegExp.build('{{h12}} : | {{h24}}', {         h12: /1[0-2]|0?[1-9]/,         h24: /2[0-3]|[01][0-9]/     }, 'x'),     minutes: /^[0-5][0-9]$/ });  time.test('10:59'); // -> true XRegExp.exec('10:59', time).minutes; // -> '59' ~~~  Named subpatterns can be provided as strings or regex objects. A leading `^` and trailing unescaped `$` are stripped from subpatterns if both are present, which allows embedding independently useful anchored patterns. `{{…}}` tokens can be quantified as a single unit. Backreferences in the outer pattern and provided subpatterns are automatically renumbered to work correctly within the larger combined pattern. The syntax `({{name}})` works as shorthand for named capture via `(?<name>{{name}})`. Named subpatterns cannot be embedded within character classes.  See also: *[Creating Grammatical Regexes Using XRegExp.build](http://blog.stevenlevithan.com/archives/grammatical-patterns-xregexp-build)*.   ### XRegExp.matchRecursive  In browsers, first include the script:  ~~~ html <script src="xregexp.js"></script> <script src="addons/matchrecursive.js"></script> ~~~  You can then match recursive constructs using XRegExp pattern strings as left and right delimiters:  ~~~ js var str = '(t((e))s)t()(ing)'; XRegExp.matchRecursive(str, '\\(', '\\)', 'g'); // -> ['t((e))s', '', 'ing']  // Extended information mode with valueNames str = 'Here is <div> <div>an</div></div> example'; XRegExp.matchRecursive(str, '<div\\s*>', '</div>', 'gi', {     valueNames: ['between', 'left', 'match', 'right'] }); /* -> [ {name: 'between', value: 'Here is ',       start: 0,  end: 8}, {name: 'left',    value: '<div>',          start: 8,  end: 13}, {name: 'match',   value: ' <div>an</div>', start: 13, end: 27}, {name: 'right',   value: '</div>',         start: 27, end: 33}, {name: 'between', value: ' example',       start: 33, end: 41} ] */  // Omitting unneeded parts with null valueNames, and using escapeChar str = '...{1}\\{{function(x,y){return y+x;}}'; XRegExp.matchRecursive(str, '{', '}', 'g', {     valueNames: ['literal', null, 'value', null],     escapeChar: '\\' }); /* -> [ {name: 'literal', value: '...', start: 0, end: 3}, {name: 'value',   value: '1',   start: 4, end: 5}, {name: 'literal', value: '\\{', start: 6, end: 8}, {name: 'value',   value: 'function(x,y){return y+x;}', start: 9, end: 35} ] */  // Sticky mode via flag y str = '<1><<<2>>><3>4<5>'; XRegExp.matchRecursive(str, '<', '>', 'gy'); // -> ['1', '<<2>>', '3'] ~~~  `XRegExp.matchRecursive` throws an error if it sees an unbalanced delimiter in the target string.   ### XRegExp Prototype Methods  In browsers, first include the script:  ~~~ html <script src="xregexp.js"></script> <script src="addons/prototypes.js"></script> ~~~  New XRegExp regexes then gain a collection of useful methods: `apply`, `call`, `forEach`, `globalize`, `xexec`, and `xtest`.  ~~~ js // To demonstrate the call method, let's first create the function we'll be using... function filter(array, fn) {     var res = [];     array.forEach(function (el) {if (fn.call(null, el)) res.push(el);});     return res; } // Now we can filter arrays using functions and regexes filter(['a', 'ba', 'ab', 'b'], XRegExp('^a')); // -> ['a', 'ab'] ~~~  Native `RegExp` objects copied by `XRegExp` are augmented with any `XRegExp.prototype` methods. The following lines therefore work equivalently:  ~~~ js XRegExp('[a-z]', 'ig').xexec('abc'); XRegExp(/[a-z]/ig).xexec('abc'); XRegExp.globalize(/[a-z]/i).xexec('abc'); ~~~   ## Installation and usage  In browsers:  ~~~ html <script src="xregexp-min.js"></script> ~~~  Or, to bundle XRegExp with all of its addons:  ~~~ html <script src="xregexp-all-min.js"></script> ~~~  Using [npm](http://npmjs.org/):  ~~~ bash npm install xregexp ~~~  In [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [CommonJS module](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules) loaders:  ~~~ js var XRegExp = require('xregexp').XRegExp; ~~~   ### Running tests on the server with npm  ~~~ bash npm install -g qunit  # needed to run the tests npm test  # in the xregexp root ~~~  If XRegExp was not installed using npm, just open `tests/index.html` in your browser.   ## &c  **Lookbehind:** A [collection of short functions](https://gist.github.com/2387872) is available that makes it easy to simulate infinite-length leading lookbehind.   ## Changelog  * Releases: [Version history](http://xregexp.com/history/). * Upcoming: [Milestones](https://github.com/slevithan/XRegExp/issues/milestones), [Roadmap](https://github.com/slevithan/XRegExp/wiki/Roadmap).   ## About  XRegExp and addons copyright 2007-2012 by [Steven Levithan](http://stevenlevithan.com/).
